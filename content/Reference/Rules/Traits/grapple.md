# Grapple  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 283*  

You can use this weapon to [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md) with the [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
