# Modular  
*Source: Lost Omens: Gods & Magic p. 120*  

The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an [Interact](interact.md) action. This typically changes the type of damage the weapon deals (listed in the trait, such as "modular B, P, or S"). However, it can also change the weapon's traits. For example, a [switchscythe's](switchscythe-lotgb.md) "modular (P and [grapple](Reference/Rules/Traits/grapple.md "Grapple Weapon Trait"), or S and [sweep](sweep.md "Sweep Weapon Trait"))" means that the [switchscythe](switchscythe-lotgb.md) can either deal piercing damage and gain the [grapple](Reference/Rules/Traits/grapple.md "Grapple Weapon Trait") trait, or it can deal slashing damage and gain the [sweep](sweep.md "Sweep Weapon Trait") trait.
