# Inscribed  
*Source: Treasure Vault p. 8*  

The armor has been treated so it can be inscribed with magical symbols using the same method as [Crafting](craft.md) a scroll. Inscribed attire can hold one scroll inscribed on it. You need a free hand to [Activate](activate-an-item.md) the scroll, but you don't need to [Interact](interact.md) to draw it. You can also [Activate](activate-an-item.md) the magic to erase the scroll the armor currently contains. You can't inscribe a new scroll onto the armor if a scroll is currently inscribed on it or if the armor is broken.
