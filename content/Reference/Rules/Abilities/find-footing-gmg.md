[concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  

- **Activate**: Single Action

The NPC attempts an [Architecture Lore](skills.md#Lore), [Engineering Lore](skills.md#Lore), or similar skill check to find a stable path across uneven ground. This grants them and anyone they share this information with a +2 circumstance bonus on [Acrobatics](skills.md#Acrobatics) checks to [Balance](balance.md) across that ground.
