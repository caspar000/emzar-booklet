# Telepathy
[aura](Reference/Rules/Traits/aura.md "Aura Combat Trait")  [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  


A monster with [telepathy](Reference/Compendium/Spells/telepathy.md) can communicate mentally with any creatures within the listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.
