**Class** investigator; **Subclass** Alchemical Sciences
- **Cost**: 1 versatile vial
- **Requirements**: You know the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, you are holding or wearing [alchemist's tools](alchemists-tools.md), and you have a free hand.
- **Activity**: Single Action

You quickly brew up a short-lived tincture. You create a single alchemical elixir or tool of your level or lower without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting) check. This item has the [infused](infused.md "Infused Item Trait") trait, but it remains potent only until the end of the current turn.
