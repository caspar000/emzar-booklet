# Create a Diversion (basic) [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
[mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 245*  

**Skill** [deception](skills.md#Deception) (untrained)
- **Activity**: Single Action

With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the [auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") and [linguistic](linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") traits.

Attempt a single [Deception](skills.md#Deception) check and compare it to the [Perception](skills.md#Perception) DCs of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their [Perception](skills.md#Perception) DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** You become hidden to each creature whose [Perception](skills.md#Perception) DC is less than or equal to your result. (The [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) condition allows you to [Sneak](sneak.md) away, as described on page 252.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except [Step](step.md) or use the [Hide](Reference/Rules/Actions/hide.md) or the [Sneak](sneak.md) action of the [Stealth](skills.md#Stealth) skill. If you [Strike](strike.md) a creature, the creature remains [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against that attack, and you then become [observed](conditions.md#Observed). If you do anything else, you become [observed](conditions.md#Observed) just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.
> - **Failure** You don't divert the attention of any creatures whose [Perception](skills.md#Perception) DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.
