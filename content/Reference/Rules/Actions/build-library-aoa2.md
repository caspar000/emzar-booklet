# Build Library
[downtime](downtime.md "Downtime Action & Ability Trait")  [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  
*Source: Age of Ashes #2: Cult of Cinders p. 73*  

- **Requirements**: [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting) (master), any [Lore](skills.md#Lore) (master), or hired bookmaker; organized specialists

Pick a single room in Citadel Altaerein to serve as a library. Once complete, the library grants a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks made to [Borrow an Arcane Spell](borrow-an-arcane-spell.md), [Create Forgery](create-forgery.md), [Decipher Writing](decipher-writing.md), [Identify Alchemy](identify-alchemy.md), [Identify Magic](identify-magic.md), [Learn a Spell](learn-a-spell.md), or [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) as long as the PC performing the action is on site. This upgrade takes 20 days of work and a DC 25 [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting) or [Lore](skills.md#Lore) check.
