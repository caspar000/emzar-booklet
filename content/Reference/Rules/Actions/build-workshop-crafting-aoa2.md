- **Requirements**: [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting) (master), Specialty Crafting (any), or any hired specialist; organized specialists

Pick a room in Citadel Altaerein to serve as a crafting area for a specific [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting) skill chosen from one of the crafting specialties listed under the [Specialty Crafting](specialty-crafting.md) feat. You can have multiple workshops, each devoted to its own skill. Use of a workshop grants a +1 circumstance bonus to [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting) checks, or a +3 circumstance bonus to [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting) skill checks associated with that workshop's specialty. This upgrade takes 20 days of work to complete and a DC 25 [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting) check.
