# Mighty Rage [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 85*  

**Class** barbarian
- **Trigger**: You use the [Rage](Reference/Rules/Actions/rage.md) action on your turn.
- **Activity**: Free Action

Use an action that has the [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait") trait. Alternatively, you can increase the actions of the triggering [Rage](Reference/Rules/Actions/rage.md) to 2 to instead use a 2-action activity with the rage trait.
