You focus your efforts on helping citizens escape or recover from wounds. Attempt a DC 36 [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy) or [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation) check to direct citizens to safety, a DC 38 [Medicine](skills.md#Medicine) check to treat injured survivors, or a DC 40 [Society](skills.md#Society) check to know about unusual escape routes to safety from the building and the surrounding alleys.

> - **Critical Success** Your efforts are resoundingly successful. Roll `2d6`â€”this is the number of citizens trapped in the building who you lead to safety or the number of citizens who succumbed during this or the previous phase who you've managed to nurse back to life from the brink of death, split any way you wish.
> - **Success** You rescue `1d6` citizens from the flames.
> - **Failure** You fail to rescue any citizens from the fire and take `2d6` fire damage.
> - **Critical Failure** You take `4d6` fire damage as a blast of fire and falling debris strikes you. For every 5 fire damage you take from this, one citizen still trapped in the building perishes.
