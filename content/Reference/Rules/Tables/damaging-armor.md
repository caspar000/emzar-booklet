# Damaging Armor  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 276*  

Your armor's statistics are based on the material it's predominantly made from. It's not likely your armor will take damage, as explained in Item Damage on page 272.

| Leather ([hide](Reference/Compendium/Equipment/Items/hide.md), [leather](leather.md), [studded leather](studded-leather.md)) | 4 | 16 | 8 |
| Metal ([breastplate](breastplate.md), [chain mail](chain-mail.md), [chain shirt](chain-shirt.md), [full plate](full-plate.md), [half plate](half-plate.md), [scale mail](scale-mail.md), [splint mail](splint-mail.md)) | 9 | 36 | 18 |
