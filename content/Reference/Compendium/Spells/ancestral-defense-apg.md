# Ancestral Defense *Focus 3*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [cursebound](cursebound-apg.md "Cursebound Spell Trait")  [fortune](fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [oracle](Reference/Rules/Traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: You are about to attempt a Will save.
- 

Your ancestor protects you against those who would bend your will. You roll the triggering save twice and use the better result. If you're in an encounter when you cast this spell, you immediately roll to change your predominant ancestor.
