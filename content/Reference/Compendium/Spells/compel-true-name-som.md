- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature whose true name you know
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: varies

You instruct the target to do something, compelling obedience by calling it by its true name. Your instructions can't be self-destructive. Though this spell has the [linguistic](linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") trait, this applies only to the instructions; the creature doesn't need to know its own true name to be affected.

The target must attempt a Will saving throw.

> - **Success** The target is unaffected, is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 day, and learns a fragment of your true name (see the Fragmentary Names sidebar at right).

> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the spell's duration is 8 hours, and the creature is not temporarily immune.
