# Word Of Freedom *Focus 4*   
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains** [freedom](Reference/Compendium/Setting/domains.md#Freedom)
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: 1 round

You utter a liberating word of power that frees a creature.

You suppress one of the following conditions of your choice: [confused](conditions.md#Confused), [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened), [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed), [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained), or [paralyzed](conditions.md#Paralyzed). The target isn't affected by the chosen condition, and if you suppress the [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) condition, the target automatically breaks free from any grab or restraint affecting it when you [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md).

If you don't remove the effect that provided the condition, the condition returns after the spell ends. For example, if a spell was making the target [confused](conditions.md#Confused) for 1 minute, word of freedom would let the target act normally for a round, but the [confused](conditions.md#Confused) condition would return afterward.
