# Prismatic Armor *Spell 7*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 willing creature
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You wrap the target in armor made of multicolored light.

It functions as [chromatic armor](chromatic-armor-som.md) that is all colors (granting resistance 5 to acid, electricity, fire, force, mental, poison, and sonic). An attacker that critically fails on its saving throw against the spell is [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) rather than [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled).

**Heightened (9th)** The resistances increase to 10 each.
