# Blur *Spell 2*

- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 creature

The target's form appears blurry. It becomes [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed). As the nature of this effect still leaves the target's location obvious, the target can't use this concealment to [Hide](Reference/Rules/Actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](sneak.md).
