# Worm's Repast *Spell 2*   
[necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 corporeal creature
- **Saving Throw**: Fortitude
- **Duration**: see below

Gnawing worms materialize within the flesh of the target creature, dealing `4d6` piercing damage and `1d6` [persistent piercing damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). If the target is a non-skeletal corporeal undead creature, you deal an extra `2d6` [persistent piercing damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The worms writhe away harmlessly and the target takes no damage.
> - **Success** The target takes full initial damage but no [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and the spell ends immediately.
> - **Failure** The target takes full initial and [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) due to the pain for as long as it takes [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double the initial damage and is also [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) by the pain for as long as it takes [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 2)** : The initial and [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increase by `2d6` and `1d6`, respectively.
