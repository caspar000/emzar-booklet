# Reinforce Eidolon *Cantrip 1*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [cantrip](cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [summoner](Reference/Rules/Traits/summoner-som.md "Summoner Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 100 foot
- **Targets**: your eidolon
- **Duration**: 1 round

You focus deeply on the link between you and your eidolon and reinforce your eidolon's defenses. Your eidolon gains a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws, plus resistance to all damage equal to half the spell's level. Your eidolon can benefit from either [boost eidolon](boost-eidolon-som.md) or [reinforce eidolon](Reference/Compendium/Spells/reinforce-eidolon-som.md), but not both; if you cast one of these spells during the other's duration, the newer spell replaces the older one.
