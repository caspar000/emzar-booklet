Accelerated by your ki, you move with such speed you become a blur. Move two times: two [Strides](stride.md), two [Steps](step.md), or one [Stride](stride.md) and one [Step](step.md) (in either order). You gain the [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) condition during this movement and until the start of your next turn.
