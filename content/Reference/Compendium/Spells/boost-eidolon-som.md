# Boost Eidolon *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [summoner](Reference/Rules/Traits/summoner-som.md "Summoner Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 100 foot
- **Targets**: your eidolon
- **Duration**: 1 round

You focus deeply on the link between you and your eidolon and boost the power of your eidolon's attacks. Your eidolon gains a +2 status bonus to damage rolls with its unarmed attacks. If your eidolon's [Strikes](strike.md) deal more than one weapon damage die, the status bonus increases to 2 per weapon damage die, to a maximum of +8 with four weapon damage dice.
