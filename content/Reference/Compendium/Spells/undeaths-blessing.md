# Undeath's Blessing *Focus 1*   
[necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [negative](negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  [sorcerer](Reference/Rules/Traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 living creature touched
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You instill within a creature the touch of the grave. For the duration, [harm](harm.md) and [heal](heal.md) spells treat the creature as undead. In addition, [harm](harm.md) spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target.

If the target wishes to avoid the spell, it can attempt a Will save to reduce the effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target heals half as much from [heal](heal.md) and takes half as much damage from [harm](harm.md) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** Effects as described in the text.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The status bonus to the Hit Points restored increases by 2.
