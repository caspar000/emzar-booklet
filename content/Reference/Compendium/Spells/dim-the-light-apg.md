# Dim The Light *Focus 1*   
[darkness](Reference/Rules/Traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait")  [evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [sorcerer](Reference/Rules/Traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: You cast a darkness or shadow spell.
- 

You magnify the darkness from the triggering effect, causing the ambient light level to flicker briefly so you can slip from sight. You can immediately attempt a [Stealth](skills.md#Stealth) check to [Hide](Reference/Rules/Actions/hide.md), and you can become [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to a creature even if you don't have cover and aren't otherwise [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) from that creature.

You cease being [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) at the end of your turn unless you move into cover or become [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) before then.
