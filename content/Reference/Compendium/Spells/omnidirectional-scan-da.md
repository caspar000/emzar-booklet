# Omnidirectional Scan *Cantrip 3*   
[cantrip](cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [psychic](Reference/Rules/Traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  [scrying](Reference/Rules/Traits/scrying.md "Scrying Effect Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Area**: 30-foot emanation
- **Targets**: 1 ally and 1 enemy
- **Duration**: until the start of your next turn

You quickly view your surroundings from a variety of angles, your senses constructing an overall mental picture. You can choose to [Seek](seek.md) the entire emanation of the spell.

Regardless of whether you [Seek](seek.md), target one ally and one enemy in the area; if a target is [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from you, you automatically succeed at the flat check to target it with this spell. You prepare to [Aid](aid.md) the target ally on an attack roll against the target enemy. If you take this [Aid](aid.md) reaction, you use your spell attack modifier and proficiency rank on your check to [Aid](aid.md). If you critically fail the roll to [Aid](aid.md), you get a failure instead.

## Amp

Your scans are so minute that you can project your foe's likely strengths and weaknesses. You learn which of the target enemy's saving throws is highest and which is lowest, and you and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attacks and damage against the creature.

If you take the [Aid](aid.md) reaction you prepared for and succeed at your roll, these bonuses increase to +2 on the attack you're Aiding. On a critical success, they increase to +3, or to +4 if you have legendary proficiency in spell attack rolls.
