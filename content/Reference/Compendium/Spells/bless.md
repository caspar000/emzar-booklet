# Bless *Spell 1*   
[enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**: 5-foot emanation

Blessings from beyond help your companions strike true.

You and your allies in the area gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls. Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast [bless](bless.md), you can use a single action, which has the [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. Bless can counteract bane.
