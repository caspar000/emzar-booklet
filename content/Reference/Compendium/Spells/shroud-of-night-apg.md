- **Patron** Witch
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

Drawing your hand in a sweeping gesture, you shroud the target in a veil of night. The target's eyes are blanketed in darkness. If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with light blindness), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target is shrouded in murky darkness. Unless the target has [darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md), other creatures are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to it.
