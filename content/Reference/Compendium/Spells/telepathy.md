# Telepathy *Spell 4*   
[divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [linguistic](linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet. Once you establish a connection by communicating with a creature, the communication is two-way. You can communicate only with creatures that share a language with you.

**Heightened (6th)** Telepathy loses the [linguistic](linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") trait. You can communicate telepathically with creatures using shared mental imagery even if you don't share a language.
