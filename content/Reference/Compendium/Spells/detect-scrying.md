# Detect Scrying *Spell 4*   
[detection](detection.md "Detection Effect Trait")  [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**: 30-foot emanation
- **Duration**: 1 hour

By tapping into trace divinatory auras, you detect the presence of [scrying](Reference/Rules/Traits/scrying.md "Scrying Effect Trait") effects in the area. If detect scrying is higher level than a [scrying](Reference/Rules/Traits/scrying.md "Scrying Effect Trait") effect, you gain a glimpse of the scrying creature and learn its approximate distance and direction.

**Heightened (6th)** The duration is until the next time you make your daily preparations.
