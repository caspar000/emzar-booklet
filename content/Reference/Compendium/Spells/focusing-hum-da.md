# Focusing Hum *Spell 3*   
[divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Area**: 15-foot emanation centered on you
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You infuse the air around you with a sustained hum that allows creatures within it to resist distractions. The DC of any flat check to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) while [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) for creatures within the area is 2 lower. [Confused](conditions.md#Confused) creatures in the area don't attack anyone, including themselves, and instead lose the ability to speak coherently. You take a â€“2 penalty to [Stealth](skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Hide](Reference/Rules/Actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](sneak.md).
