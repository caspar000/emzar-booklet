# Mind Blank *Spell 8*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: until the next time you make your daily preparations

Powerful wards hide a creature from divination magic. The target gains a +4 status bonus to saves against [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects.

Mind blank attempts to counteract any detection, [revelation](revelation.md "Revelation Effect Trait"), and [scrying](Reference/Rules/Traits/scrying.md "Scrying Effect Trait") effects as if its spell level were 1 higher than its actual level. On a success, the [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait") effect functions normally except that it detects nothing about the target and its possessions. For instance, detect magic would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.
