# Lament *Focus 1*   
[auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Domains** [sorrow](Reference/Compendium/Setting/domains.md#Sorrow)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30-foot cone
- **Targets**: 1 or more creatures
- **Saving Throw**:  basic Will

You let out your negative emotions in a guttural wail that shakes your enemies' hearts and deals `1d8` mental damage (basic Will save). If you have any harmful conditions imposed by [emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effects, lament deals additional mental damage equal to the counteract level of the highest-level effect.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d8`.
