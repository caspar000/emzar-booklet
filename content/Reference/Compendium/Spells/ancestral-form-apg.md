# Ancestral Form *Focus 6*   
[cursebound](cursebound-apg.md "Cursebound Spell Trait")  [oracle](Reference/Rules/Traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You take the form of your ancestral spirits, becoming [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) and quasi-corporeal. You gain resistance 10 to all damage (except force and damage from [Strikes](strike.md) with the [ghost touch](ghost-touch.md) property rune), and this resistance is doubled against non-magical and precision damage. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed; when Flying, moving upward isn't difficult terrain for you. You can't move through solid objects, but you can float through tiny gaps. You can't [Cast Spells](cast-a-spell.md) (but you can Sustain a Spell), activate items, or use actions that have the [attack](attack.md "Attack Combat Trait") or [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistance increases by 5.
