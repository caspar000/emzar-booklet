# Wordsmith *Focus 4*   
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Domains** [knowledge (apocryphal)](Reference/Compendium/Setting/domains.md#Knowledge)
- **Cast** [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**: touch
- **Targets**: 1 document written by a single author and comprised of written text in a single language
- **Duration**: until the next time you [Refocus](refocus.md)

You're a devotee of knowledge with an unmatched command of the language used to spread that knowledge, and you can reshape the written word into a form more understandable to your audience. The language of the target's written text shifts to a language you know. This shift doesn't change the text's contents beyond minor translation differences, nor does it grant the reader any understanding of the original language.
