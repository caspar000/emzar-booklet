# Hero's Defiance *Focus 10*   
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [healing](healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [positive](positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 
- **Trigger**: An attack would bring you to 0 Hit Points.
- 

You shout in defiance, filling you with a sudden burst of healing.

Just before applying the attack's damage, you recover `10d4+20` Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) or [dying](conditions.md#Dying).

Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use hero's defiance again until you [Refocus](refocus.md) or the next time you prepare.

Hero's defiance cannot be used against effects with the [death](death.md "Death Effect Trait") trait or that would leave no remains, such as [disintegrate](disintegrate.md).
