# Jump *Spell 1*   
[move](move.md "Move Combat Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- 

Your legs surge with strength, ready to leap high and far. You jump 30 feet in any direction without touching the ground. You must land on a space of solid ground within 30 feet of you, or else you fall after using your next action.

**Heightened (3rd)** The range becomes touch, the target changes to one touched creature, and the duration becomes 1 minute, allowing the target to jump as described whenever it takes the [Leap](leap.md) action.
