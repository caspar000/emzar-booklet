# Vigilant Eye *Focus 4*   
[divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [wizard](Reference/Rules/Traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 500 foot
- **Duration**: 1 hour

You create an [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) eye sensor, as [clairvoyance](clairvoyance.md).

When created, this eye must be in your line of sight. When the spell's duration ends, you can spend 1 Focus Point as a free action to extend the duration for another hour, though as normal, it ends immediately during your next daily preparations.
