# Drop Dead *Spell 5*   
[illusion](illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [visual](visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: A creature within range is hit by an attack from an enemy.
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible). Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant the attacker an immediate [Perception](skills.md#Perception) check to 0. If the target uses [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) actions, the spell ends. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.

**Heightened (7th)** The spell doesn't end if the target uses [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) actions.
