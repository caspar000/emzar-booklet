You meditate upon perfection to remove all distractions from your mind. Attempt a new Will save against one [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect currently affecting you that required a Will save. Use the result of this new save to determine the outcome of the [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect, unless the new save would have a worse result than the original save, in which case nothing happens. You can use perfected mind against a given effect only once.
