# Warp Mind *Spell 7*   
[emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [incapacitation](incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Saving Throw**: Will

You scramble a creature's mental faculties and sensory input.

The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. Warp mind's effects happen instantly, so [dispel magic](dispel-magic.md) and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them. However, [alter reality](alter-reality.md), [miracle](miracle.md), [primal phenomenon](primal-phenomenon.md), [restoration](restoration.md), or [wish](wish.md) can still counteract the effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target spends the first action on its next turn with the [confused](conditions.md#Confused) condition.
> - **Failure** The target is [confused](conditions.md#Confused) for 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [confused](conditions.md#Confused) permanently.
