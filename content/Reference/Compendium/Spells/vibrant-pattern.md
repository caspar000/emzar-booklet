# Vibrant Pattern *Spell 6*   
[illusion](illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [incapacitation](incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [visual](visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 120 foot
- **Area**: 10-foot burst
- **Saving Throw**: Will
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity.

Creatures are [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) while inside the pattern.

In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a [Seek](seek.md) or [Interact](interact.md) action on the pattern. A creature currently [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature is [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover from the [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) condition at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute.
