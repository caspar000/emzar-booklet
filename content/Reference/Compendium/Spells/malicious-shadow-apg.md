# Malicious Shadow *Focus 3*   
[evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [hex](hex-apg.md "Hex Combat Trait")  [shadow](Reference/Rules/Traits/shadow.md "Shadow General Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [witch](Reference/Rules/Traits/witch-apg.md "Witch Class Trait")  

- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature
- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

You reshape the target's shadow into a deadly form, such as strangling hands, a dangerous weapon, harrying runes, or the like, and command it to attack the target. When you [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md), and each time you [Sustain the Spell](sustain-a-spell.md), the shadow makes a [Strike](strike.md) against the target. The shadow moves along with the foe, always remaining within reach. If you [Sustain the Spell](sustain-a-spell.md) multiple times in a round, you gain this effect each time. The shadow uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.

The shadow's [Strikes](strike.md) are melee spell attacks. Regardless of its shape, the shadow's [Strikes](strike.md) deal damage equal to `1d10` plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You choose the type of damage when you [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md), choosing from bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. The shadow doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The shadow can't make any attacks other than its [Strike](strike.md).

The shadow vanishes if the target moves into an area of complete darkness or enters an area with light from all directions such that the target doesn't cast a shadow. If another effect is controlling the target's shadow when you cast [malicious shadow](malicious-shadow-apg.md), you can attempt to counteract that effect to temporarily take control of the shadow, but the original effect resumes when malicious shadow ends.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The [Strike](strike.md) damage increases by `1d10`.
