# Bind Undead *Spell 3*   
[necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Traditions** [arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 mindless undead creature with a level no greater than bind undead's spell level
- **Duration**: 1 day

With a word of necromantic power, you seize control of the target. It gains the minion trait. If you or an ally uses any [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) actions against the target, the spell ends.
