[attack](attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")  [electricity](electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait")  [evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  

- **Domains** [lightning](Reference/Compendium/Setting/domains.md#Lightning)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: 1 or more creatures

You fire a javelin of electricity that leaves a charged field around its target. Make a spell attack roll. The javelin deals `1d6` electricity damage and 1 [persistent electricity damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The javelin deals double damage, both initial and persistent.
> - **Success** The javelin deals full damage. As long as the target is taking [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from this spell, creatures gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls with metal weapons or [electricity](electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait") effects against the target, and the target takes a â€“1 status penalty to saves against [electricity](electricity.md "Electricity Energy & Element Trait") effects.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `1d6`, and the [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by 1.
