> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened), but if it spends an action to end the condition, it succeeds automatically.
> - **Failure** The target is [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened). A target [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened) by this spell takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speed until it's no longer [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened).
