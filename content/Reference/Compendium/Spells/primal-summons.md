[conjuration](conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [druid](Reference/Rules/Traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 
- 

You enhance a summoned creature with the power of the elements. If your next action is to cast either [summon animal](summon-animal.md) or [summon plant or fungus](summon-plant-or-fungus.md), choose [air](air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait"), [earth](earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait"), [fire](fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait"), or [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait"), and the creature you summon gains the corresponding abilities.

- **Air** The creature gains a fly Speed of 60 feet.
- **Earth** The creature gains a burrow Speed of 20 feet, reduces its land Speed by 10 feet (minimum 5 feet), and gains resistance 5 to physical damage.
- **Fire** The creature's attacks deal `1d6` extra fire damage, and it gains resistance 10 to fire and weakness 5 to cold and water.
- **Water** The creature gains a swim Speed of 60 feet, can spend 1 action after a melee attack to attempt a [Shove](Reference/Rules/Actions/shove.md) (ignoring multiple attack penalty), and gains resistance 5 to fire.
