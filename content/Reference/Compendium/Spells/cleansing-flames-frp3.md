You wrap the target in purifying flames. You can attempt to counteract a single poison or non-curse effect imparting the [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy), [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled), [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled), [fatigued](conditions.md#Fatigued), [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened), [paralyzed](conditions.md#Paralyzed), [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened), or [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) condition.

The target can choose to empower the flames with their life force, becoming [drained](conditions.md#Drained) (or increasing their [drained](conditions.md#Drained) value by 1, if already under the condition) to grant you a +1 circumstance bonus to your counteract check.
