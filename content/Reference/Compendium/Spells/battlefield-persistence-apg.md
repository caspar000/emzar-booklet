# Battlefield Persistence *Focus 3*   
[cursebound](cursebound-apg.md "Cursebound Spell Trait")  [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [oracle](Reference/Rules/Traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**: You are about to attempt a saving throw, but you haven't rolled yet.
- 

You're difficult to remove from battle. You gain a +2 status bonus to the triggering save, and if the triggering save is against an [incapacitation](incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") effect, it treats you as if you were 2 levels higher.
