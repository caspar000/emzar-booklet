# Vital Beacon *Spell 4*   
[healing](healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [positive](positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** 1 minute 
- 
- **Duration**: until your next daily preparations

Vitality radiates outward from you, allowing others to supplicate and receive healing. Once per round, either you or an ally can use an [Interact](interact.md) action to supplicate and lay hands upon you to regain Hit Points. Each time the beacon heals someone, it decreases in strength. It restores `4d10` Hit Points to the first creature, `4d8` Hit Points to the second, `4d6` Hit Points to the third, and `4d4` Hit Points to the fourth, after which the spell ends. You can have only one vital beacon active at a time.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The beacon restores one additional die of Hit Points each time it heals, using the same die size as the others for that step.
