# Ectoplasmic Expulsion *Spell 5*   
[mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Traditions** [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature

You call upon tendrils of ephemeral ectoplasm to pass through the target and carry away a harmful psychic affliction.

You immediately attempt to counteract a single effect on the target with the [emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") or [possession](Reference/Rules/Traits/possession.md "Possession Effect Trait") trait, or an effect giving the target the [controlled](conditions.md#Controlled) or [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated) condition. If you fail to counteract the effect, you nevertheless set up a resonance that allows the target to more ably escape the effect on its own; for the next hour, the target gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves to shrug off the effect you failed to counteract (such as Will saves to shake off control by the [possession](Reference/Compendium/Spells/possession.md) spell).
