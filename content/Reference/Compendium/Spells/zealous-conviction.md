# Zealous Conviction *Spell 6*   
[emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Traditions** [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: up to 10 willing creatures
- **Duration**: 10 minutes

You bypass your targets' rational minds, instilling them with unshakable conviction and zeal. The targets each gain 12 temporary Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to Will saves against [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects, as their faith overrides the signals from their own bodies and minds. If you tell a target to do something, it must comply with your request, though if it would normally find the task repugnant, it can attempt a Will save at the end of its turn each round due to the cognitive dissonance. On a success, it ends the spell's effects on itself entirely.

**Heightened (9th)** The temporary Hit Points increase to 18, and the status bonus to Will saves increases to +3.
