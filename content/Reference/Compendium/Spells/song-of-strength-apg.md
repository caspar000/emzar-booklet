[bard](Reference/Rules/Traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [cantrip](cantrip.md "Cantrip Spell Trait")  [composition](composition.md "Composition Spell Trait")  [emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Area**: 60-foot emanation
- **Duration**: 1 round

You bolster your allies' physical strength with a hearty exhortation. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) checks and to their DCs against [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) skill actions such as [Disarm](Reference/Rules/Actions/disarm.md), [Shove](Reference/Rules/Actions/shove.md), and [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md).

Special If you have the [inspire heroics](Reference/Compendium/Spells/inspire-heroics.md) composition spell, you can use that composition to improve the bonus granted by song of strength in the same way as inspire courage or inspire defense.
