# Dance Of Darkness *Focus 5*   
[darkness](Reference/Rules/Traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait")  [evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: varies

You dance, [Striding](stride.md) up to half your Speed. At either the start or end of your [Stride](stride.md), you create an area of magical darkness in a 10-foot burst centered on your location. This area is filled with magical darkness that works the same way as that created by a [darkness](Reference/Compendium/Spells/darkness.md) spell of the same level. When you create the darkness, attempt a [Performance](skills.md#Performance) check to dance, with a standard DC for your level, to determine the duration of the darkness.
