# Ocular Overload *Spell 4*   
[contingency](contingency-som.md "Contingency Spell Trait")  [illusion](illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [incapacitation](incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [visual](visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")

- **Cast** 10 minutes 
- 
- **Duration**: 24 hours

Just as a creature is about to attack you, you assault them with jarring illusions, completely surrounding their eyes with blinding flashes of motion and color. When the spell is complete, you gain the Overload Vision reaction; once you use the reaction, the spell ends.
