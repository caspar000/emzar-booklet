[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [good](good.md "Good Alignment Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Domains** [water (apocryphal)](Reference/Compendium/Setting/domains.md#Water)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 60 foot
- **Targets**: 1 Large or smaller creature
- **Duration**: 1 minute

Drawing on the purifying powers of water, you call forth a veil of fine water droplets suffused with holy energy. The veil surrounds the target. Everything on each side of the veil is [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) from creatures on the opposite side, but the water doesn't impede attacks or movement across the veil. If the target moves through the veil, it takes `4d6` good damage with a basic Will save. If the target leaves the veil, the spell ends.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The good damage increases by `1d6`.
