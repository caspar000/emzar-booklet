- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 creature

- **Duration**: sustained up to 1 minute

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes `1d6` cold damage, and the spell ends.
> - **Failure** The target takes `1d6` cold damage and `1d6` [persistent cold damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). (The [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) automatically ends when the spell ends.) It is [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to other creatures, and other creatures are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to it.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but both the cold damage and the [persistent cold damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increase to `2d6`.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The cold damage and [persistent cold damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increase by 1 (2 on a critical failure).
