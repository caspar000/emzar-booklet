- **Traditions** [arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- 
- **Duration**: until the start of your next turn

You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the [Raise a Shield](raise-a-shield.md) action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn't require a hand to use.

While the spell is in effect, you can use the [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md) reaction with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness 5. After you use [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md), the spell ends and you can't cast it again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md), you can use the spell's reaction against the [magic missile](magic-missile.md) spell.

Heightening the spell increases the shield's Hardness.

**Heightened (3rd)** The shield has Hardness 10.

**Heightened (5th)** The shield has Hardness 15.

**Heightened (7th)** The shield has Hardness 20.

**Heightened (9th)** The shield has Hardness 25.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
