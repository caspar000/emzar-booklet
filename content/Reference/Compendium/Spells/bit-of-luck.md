# Bit Of Luck *Focus 1*   
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [fortune](fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Domains** [luck](Reference/Compendium/Setting/domains.md#Luck)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 willing creature
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You tilt the scales of luck slightly to protect a creature from disaster. When the target would attempt a saving throw, it can roll twice and use the better result. Once it does this, the spell ends.

If you cast [bit of luck](bit-of-luck.md) again, any previous bit of luck you cast that's still in effect ends. After a creature has been targeted with bit of luck, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
