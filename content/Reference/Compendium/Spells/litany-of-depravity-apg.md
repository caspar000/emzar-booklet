# Litany Of Depravity *Focus 7*   
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [evil](evil.md "Evil Alignment Trait")  [evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [litany](litany.md "Litany Spell Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**: 30 foot
- **Targets**: 1 good creature
- **Duration**: 1 round

Your litany calls into question the morals your foe claims to hold dear. The target gains weakness 7 to evil, then becomes temporarily immune to all your litanies for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The weakness increases by 1.
