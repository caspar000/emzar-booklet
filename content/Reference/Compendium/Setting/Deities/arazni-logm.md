## Divine intercession
*Source: Lost Omens: Gods & Magic Web Supplement p. 4*

While the Unyielding has little regard for her followers, if suitably irritated or impressed, she might bestow the following banes or boons.

- **Minor Boon** Once, when you fail a saving throw against an effect that would compel you to take some action against your will, you critically succeed instead. Arazni typically grants this boon for consequential actions or particularly egregious violations of free will.
- **Moderate Boon**: Blood from your wounds forms into armor or a piece of equipment you need. If what you need most is information, the blood forms letters spelling out that information.
- **Major Boon**: Upon death, you return to life with the effects of a critical success on a [resurrect](resurrect.md) ritual to enact vengeance against your killers. When you successfully achieve vengeance, abandon your vengeance for other pursuits, or fail outright, you crumble to scarlet dust.

- **Minor Curse**: Someone you've wronged gains information they desire about you, with the effects of a critical success at the [commune](commune.md) ritual.
- **Moderate Curse** Creatures weaker than you gain a status bonus on all attack rolls against you equal to your difference in levels, to a maximum of +4. Whenever you are damaged by a such a creature, you take [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to twice the difference between your levels (no maximum).
- **Major Curse**: When you would regain Hit Points due to either a [positive](positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait") or [negative](negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait") effect, you lose that many Hit Points instead.
