# Shattering Blows  *Feat 16*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  


Your forceful blows shatter objects with ease. While you are [raging](Reference/Rules/Actions/rage.md), your melee [Strikes](strike.md) ignore 5 points of an object's Hardness. If you have the devastator class feature, you instead ignore 10 points of an object's Hardness.
