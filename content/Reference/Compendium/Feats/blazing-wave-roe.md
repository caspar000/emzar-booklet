# Blazing Wave  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[fire](fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [overflow](overflow-roe.md "Overflow Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Flames flow out of you in a cascade, engulfing everyone in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area takes `4d6` fire damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails its save is knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone).
