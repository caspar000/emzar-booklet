# Corrupted Shield  *Feat 6*  
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [negative](negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (shield), tenets of evil

Your shield ally is more than just a spirit of protectionâ€” it's a conduit for deadly divine magic. When you use your shield ally to [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md) a melee unarmed attack or a melee weapon [Strike](strike.md) from an adjacent creature, the attacker takes `1d6` evil or negative damage (your choice). If the attack or [Strike](strike.md) breaks or destroys your shield, double this additional damage.

The damage the attacker takes increases to `2d6` at 11th level and `3d6` at 16th level.
