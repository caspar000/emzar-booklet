# Protective Bond  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [summoner](Reference/Rules/Traits/summoner-som.md "Summoner Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** You and your eidolon are in a damaging effect's area.
- **Activity** Reaction

The power of your bond can protect you and your eidolon from harm. If you and your eidolon would take different amounts of damage from the area effect, you take the lower amount of damage instead of the greater amount of damage.

**Special.** This feat has the trait matching your eidolon's tradition ([arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait"), or [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")).
