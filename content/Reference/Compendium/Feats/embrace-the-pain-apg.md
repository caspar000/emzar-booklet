- **Trigger** A creature damages you with a melee attack.
- **Activity** Reaction

Ignoring your pain, you reach out and grab the creature or weapon that caused you harm. Attempt an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md) the triggering creature or to [Disarm](Reference/Rules/Actions/disarm.md) the creature of the triggering weapon.
