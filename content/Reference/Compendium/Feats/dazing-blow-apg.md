# Dazing Blow  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[fighter](Reference/Rules/Traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [press](press.md "Press Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You have a creature [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed).

The weapon damage from this [Strike](strike.md) is bludgeoning damage. If the [Strike](strike.md) hits, the creature must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC; this is an [incapacitation](incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait") effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned).
> - **Failure** The creature is [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned).
