# Glamour  *Feat 13*  
[rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Fey Influence](fey-influence-loil.md)

You unlock a new level of fey power and can manipulate the perceptions of others using a font of First World magic. You gain the [fey glamour](fey-glamour.md) focus spell (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 404) as a primal spell that doesn't have the [sorcerer](Reference/Rules/Traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait") trait. If you don't already have a focus pool, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point.

**Special.** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).
