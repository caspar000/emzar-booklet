# Knock Sense  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [fighter](Reference/Rules/Traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Activity** Single Action

You attack carefully to knock some sense into a creature whose actions aren't their own. Make a [Strike](strike.md) against a [confused](conditions.md#Confused) ally. The [Strike](strike.md) is nonlethal and doesn't take a â€“2 penalty for using a weapon without the [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") trait; if you hit and deal damage, your ally automatically succeeds at the flat check to remove the [confused](conditions.md#Confused) condition when taking damage.
