# One For All  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [linguistic](linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [swashbuckler](Reference/Rules/Traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy)
- **Activity** Single Action

With precisely the right words of encouragement, you bolster an ally's efforts. Designate an ally within 30 feet; this action counts as sufficient preparation to [Aid](aid.md) that ally. When you use the [Aid](aid.md) reaction to help that ally, you can roll [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy) in place of the usual check. If your swashbuckler's style is wit and your [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy) check to [Aid](aid.md) meets or exceeds the very hard DC for your level, you gain panache.
