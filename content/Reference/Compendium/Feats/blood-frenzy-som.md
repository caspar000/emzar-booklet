Your eidolon flies into a frenzy. It gains the benefits of [boost eidolon](boost-eidolon-som.md) and gains temporary HP equal to your level, but takes a â€“2 penalty to AC. It can't voluntarily end the frenzy or start another frenzy while in the frenzy. The frenzy lasts for 1 minute, after which your eidolon is [fatigued](conditions.md#Fatigued) for 1 minute and can't start another frenzy for 1 minute.
