[earth](earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [overflow](overflow-roe.md "Overflow Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You unleash a small, localized tremor in a 10-foot burst within 30 feet. Each creature in the area takes `1d8` bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails is knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone). Earth and stone in the area is difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.
