# Point-blank Shot  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[fighter](Reference/Rules/Traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [open](open.md "Open Combat Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a ranged weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You take aim to pick off nearby enemies quickly. When using a ranged volley weapon while you are in this stance, you don't take the penalty to your attack rolls from the [volley](volley.md "Volley Weapon Trait") trait. When using a ranged weapon that doesn't have the [volley](volley.md "Volley Weapon Trait") trait, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to damage rolls on attacks against targets within the weapon's first range increment.
