# Form Lock  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[attack](attack.md "Attack Combat Trait")  [monk](Reference/Rules/Traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You have a foe [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Single Action

Your ability to control your own ki empowers you to pressure other creatures into resuming their true forms. Attempt an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to counteract a [polymorph](polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") effect currently affecting your target. If the target is somehow under the effect of multiple [polymorph](polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") effects, you can choose which one to attempt to counteract, or the GM chooses randomly if the separate effects aren't obvious. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
