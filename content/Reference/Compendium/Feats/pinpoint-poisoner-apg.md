# Pinpoint Poisoner  *Feat 8*  
[alchemist](Reference/Rules/Traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  


Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your poisons. When you successfully [Strike](strike.md) a [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) creature with a poisoned weapon or expose a [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) creature to an inhaled poison, the [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) condition also gives that creature a –2 circumstance penalty to its initial save against that poison.
