# Breath Like Honey  *Feat 9*  
[gnoll](gnoll-b1.md "Gnoll Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: sweetbreath gnoll heritage

You smell of honey and savory things. You can cast [enthrall](enthrall.md) as a 3rd-level occult innate spell once per day, except the spell has a range of 30 feet and the [inhaled](inhaled.md "Inhaled Item Trait") trait instead of the [auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") trait. Targets don't gain any circumstance bonus for disagreeing with you. Your circumstance bonus to checks to [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md) if the target can smell your breath increases to +2.
