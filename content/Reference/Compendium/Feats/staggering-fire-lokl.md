[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [press](press.md "Press Combat Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Archer Dedication](archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You've learned how to fire at enemies to slow them down, allowing innocents and fellow knights alike time to escape. Make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) with a weapon in the bow weapon group. On a hit, the target takes a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed until the end of its turn, or a –10-foot circumstance penalty on a critical hit.
