- **Activity** Three-Action

Dark thunderclouds swirl in a miniature storm, crisscrossed with lightning bolts; a tremendous thunderclap fills the air. The storm appears in a 20-foot burst within 60 feet. Each creature in the area takes `3d12` electricity damage and `1d10` sonic damage, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened) until the end of its next turn (or for 1 minute on a critical failure). A creature wearing metal armor or made of metal takes a â€“1 circumstance penalty to its save.
