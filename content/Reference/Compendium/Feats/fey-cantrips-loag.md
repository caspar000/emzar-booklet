# Fey Cantrips  *Feat 1*  
[sprite](sprite-b1.md "Sprite Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You've learned the cantrips sprites have used since time immemorial. You gain [dancing lights](dancing-lights.md) and [ghost sound](ghost-sound.md) as primal innate cantrips. If you have the grig heritage, you also gain [detect magic](Reference/Compendium/Spells/detect-magic.md), and if you have the draxie heritage, you gain [prestidigitation](prestidigitation.md).
