# Ranged Combatant  *Feat 2*  
[evolution](evolution-som.md "Evolution Feat Trait")  [summoner](Reference/Rules/Traits/summoner-som.md "Summoner Class Trait")  


Spines, flame jets, and holy blasts are just some of the ways your eidolon might strike from a distance. It gains a ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 30 feet that deals `1d4` damage and has the [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait") and [propulsive](propulsive.md "Propulsive Weapon Trait") traits. When you select this feat, choose a damage type: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, negative, piercing, positive, or slashing.

If your eidolon is a celestial, fiend, or monitor with an alignment other than true neutral, you can choose a damage type in its alignment.
