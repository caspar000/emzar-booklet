# Forestall Curse  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [oracle](Reference/Rules/Traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You've learned to forestall the effects of your curse somewhat. If the next action you use is to cast a [revelation](revelation.md "Revelation Effect Trait") spell, the severity of your curse doesn't increase.
