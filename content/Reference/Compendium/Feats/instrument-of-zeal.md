# Instrument Of Zeal  *Feat 16*  
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (blade), tenets of good

Divine energy fills your weapon. Whenever you critically hit a foe with [Blade of Justice](blade-of-justice.md) or a [Retributive Strike](Reference/Rules/Actions/retributive-strike.md), your attack adds an extra damage die, and the target is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) on its next turn.
