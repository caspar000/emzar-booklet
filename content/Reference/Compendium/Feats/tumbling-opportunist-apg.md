- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Requirements**: Your most recent action was to [Tumble Through](tumble-through.md) or Tumbling [Strike](strike.md), and you successfully moved through an enemy's space.

You use a burst of stamina to perform a breathtaking feat of [Acrobatics](skills.md#Acrobatics) as you speed through a foe's space, leaving your foe lying flat on their back. You attempt to [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md) the enemy whose space you moved through. You can use [Acrobatics](skills.md#Acrobatics) instead of [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) for this check.
