# Furnace Form  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[fire](fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [polymorph](polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Opening your kinetic gate, you allow flames to consume your form and leave you a living flame. You gain the benefits of the [fiery body](fiery-body.md) spell (except the ability to cast ignition) until the end of your next turn. You can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute, and when you do, you can [Fly](Reference/Rules/Actions/fly.md) up to half your fly Speed. Your fire Elemental Blasts deal an additional die of damage.
