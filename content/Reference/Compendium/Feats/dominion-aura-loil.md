For a short time, you fully manifest the expectations of the god destroyer within you.

All creatures within a 10-foot emanation take `8d6` force damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails this save is also knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone). For 1 minute, any creature who ends its turn within the 10-foot emanation takes `5d6` force damage with a basic Fortitude save. If you aren't [drained](conditions.md#Drained), you can choose to become [drained](conditions.md#Drained) when you use Dominion Aura to increase the radius of the emanation from 10 feet to 20 feet.
