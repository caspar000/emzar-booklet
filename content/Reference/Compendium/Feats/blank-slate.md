# Blank Slate  *Feat 16*  
[rogue](Reference/Rules/Traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Deception](skills.md#Deception)

Your deceptions confound even the most powerful mortal divinations. [Detection](detection.md "Detection Effect Trait"), [revelation](revelation.md "Revelation Effect Trait"), and [scrying](Reference/Rules/Traits/scrying.md "Scrying Effect Trait") effects pass right over you, your possessions, and your auras, detecting nothing unless the detecting effect has a counteract level of 10 or higher. For example, [detect magic](Reference/Compendium/Spells/detect-magic.md) would still detect other magic in the area but not any magic on you, [true seeing](true-seeing.md) wouldn't reveal you, [locate](locate.md) or [scrying](Reference/Compendium/Spells/scrying.md) wouldn't find you, and so on.
