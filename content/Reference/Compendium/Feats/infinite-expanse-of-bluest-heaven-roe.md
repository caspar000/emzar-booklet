# Infinite Expanse of Bluest Heaven  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 18*

- **Activity** Three-Action

An illusion of a limitless expanse with an impossibly blue sky makes all within feel the sensation of falling... forever. The vision appears in a 20-foot burst within 100 feet. The illusion lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. Using this impulse again ends any previous one.

Each creature in the area or that later enters it must attempt a Will save against your class DC. Creatures with the [air](air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait") trait are immune. [Any](any-b1.md "Any Alignment Trait") effect of the illusion ends for a creature as soon as it leaves the illusion's area or the impulse ends, and the creature then becomes temporarily immune for 1 hour.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is off-guard.
> - **Failure** The creature is off-guard. It is [fleeing](conditions.md#Fleeing) from the illusory sky but is also disoriented; any time it uses an action to attempt to flee, it must succeed at a DC 11 flat check or flee to a space that's still within the illusion. The GM determines where the creatures ends up, but the creature can't stay stationary if it's able to move.
