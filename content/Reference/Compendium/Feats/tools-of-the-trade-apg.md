[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bounty Hunter Dedication](bounty-hunter-dedication-apg.md)

You're well-versed in weapons that allow you to bring bounties in alive. You are trained with the following weapons: bola, [sap](sap.md), and [whip](whip.md). You gain access to bolas. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the weapons listed.

In addition, you take no penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon without the [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") trait.
