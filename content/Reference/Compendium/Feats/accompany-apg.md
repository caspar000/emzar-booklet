# Accompany  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[bard](Reference/Rules/Traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  

- **Trigger** An ally within 30 feet [Casts a Spell](cast-a-spell.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

You use your performances to supplement an ally's spellcasting, providing magical energy for their spells. Attempt a [Performance](skills.md#Performance) check, [using a very high DC for the ally's level](dcs-by-level.md), and either spend a Focus Point (if the triggering spell is a focus spell) or expend a spell slot at least 1 level higher than the triggering spell. If you succeed at the [Performance](skills.md#Performance) check, your ally's spell doesn't cost the Focus Point or spell slot.
