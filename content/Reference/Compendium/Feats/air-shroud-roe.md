[air](air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

Turbulent air suffuses your kinetic aura. This doesn't displace other matter but provides air for creatures in your kinetic aura that need air to breathe. Attacks with ranged weapons take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls if their paths pass through your kinetic aura. Air in your kinetic aura is difficult terrain for flying creatures other than yourself.
