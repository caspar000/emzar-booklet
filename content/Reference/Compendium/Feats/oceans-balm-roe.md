- **Activity** Single Action

A blessing of the living sea salves wounds and douses flames. Touch a willing living creature. It regains `1d8` Hit Points and gains resistance 2 to fire for 1 minute. If it has [persistent fire damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), it can attempt a flat check to remove it with especially appropriate help. The target is temporarily immune to healing from Ocean's Balm for 10 minutes.
