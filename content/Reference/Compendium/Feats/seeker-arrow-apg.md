# Seeker Arrow  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Archer Dedication](eldritch-archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

Your shots zip around corners and fly at impossible angles to reach your target. Make a bow [Strike](strike.md) against a foe you can see; the ammunition travels to your target, even around corners. You ignore the target's [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) condition and all cover.
