# Stalwart Standard  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cavalier's Banner](cavaliers-banner-apg.md), [Knight Vigilant Dedication](knight-vigilant-dedication-locg.md)

Your banner makes it harder for your foes to push your allies around and encourages your allies to protect the innocent. Allies benefiting from your Cavalier's Banner feat also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to [Disarm](Reference/Rules/Actions/disarm.md), [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md), [Shove](Reference/Rules/Actions/shove.md), and [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md). Each benefited ally also gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls against any creature that has dealt damage to an innocent of a lower level than that ally within the last round; summoned creatures, companions, or any creatures you or your allies put into danger on purpose to attempt to gain this bonus don't count.
