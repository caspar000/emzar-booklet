# Sacral Monarch  *Feat 14*  
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [oracle](Reference/Rules/Traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sacral Lord](sacral-lord-da.md), master in [Occultism](skills.md#Occultism) or [Religion](skills.md#Religion)

You have come into your full powers and are truly a monarch of your realm, by your own definition at least. While in your territory, you can cast [banishment](banishment.md) and inevitable disaster (Secrets of Magic 111) as innate divine spells, each once per day.
