# Knockdown  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[fighter](Reference/Rules/Traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [flourish](flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You make an attack to knock a foe off balance, then follow up immediately with a sweep to topple them. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md). If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md) the creature you hit. If you're wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you can ignore [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md)'s requirement that you have a hand free. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.

## Knockdown leads to...
