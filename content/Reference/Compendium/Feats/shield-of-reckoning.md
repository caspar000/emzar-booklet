# Shield Of Reckoning  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [flourish](flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: champion's reaction, divine ally (shield), tenets of good, [Shield Warden](shield-warden-champion.md)
- **Trigger** A foe's attack against an ally matches the trigger for both your [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md) reaction and your champion's reaction.
- **Activity** Reaction

When you shield your ally against an attack, you call upon your power to protect your ally further. You use the [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md) reaction to prevent damage to an ally and also use your champion's reaction against the foe that attacked your ally.
