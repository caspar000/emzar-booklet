# Defy Fey  *Feat 6*  
[gunslinger](Reference/Rules/Traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  [investigator](Reference/Rules/Traits/investigator-apg.md "Investigator Class Trait")  [ranger](Reference/Rules/Traits/ranger.md "Ranger Class Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Greenwatch Initiate

You are keen to the wiles of the fey and can usually shake off their magic. Whenever you fail, but don't critically fail, a save against a spell with a duration of at least 1 round cast by a fey creature, you can attempt a second save against the original DC at the start of your next turn to end any lingering effects the spell might have. This can end [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) caused by a spell but can't reverse [any](any-b1.md "Any Alignment Trait") effects that have been resolved already (such as damage dealt when the spell was cast).
