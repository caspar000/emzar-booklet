# Choking Smoke  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Smoldering Explosion](smoldering-explosion-lotgb.md)

When you cast [fireball](fireball.md) heightened to at least 6th level, you can modify the spell's standard effects as follows: Reduce the spell's damage by `6d6`. Your fireball leaves behind a lingering cloud of toxic smoke in its area. While it's smoke instead of mist, this cloud otherwise has the effects of [stinking cloud](stinking-cloud.md).
