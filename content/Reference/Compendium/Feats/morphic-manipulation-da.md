# Morphic Manipulation  *Feat 7*  
[exploration](exploration.md "Exploration Action & Ability Trait")  [general](general.md "General Feat Trait")  [necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [positive](positive.md "Positive Energy & Element Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [skill](skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Nature](skills.md#Nature)

You've attuned your natural aura to that of plant life, coaxing it to grow faster than normal. You sit for 10 minutes with a small, natural non-creature plant—such as a lone flower, a small bush, or a potted succulent—while you bring your aura in tune through meditation. You coax the plant to advance one stage in its life cycle: from seed to sprout, sprout to plant, plant to flower, or flower to fruit. If the plant doesn't have proper nutrients (if you're sprouting a seed without soil or water, for example), the plant withers 5 minutes after you complete the activity. Performing this activity more than once per day renders you [fatigued](conditions.md#Fatigued) and unable to use Morphic Manipulation until your next full night's rest.
