[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: superstition instinct
- **Trigger** A creature within your reach Casts a Spell.
- **Activity** Reaction

You use your hatred of magic to lash out at the sight of spellcasting, allowing you to interrupt an enemy's spell. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit, you disrupt the spell.
