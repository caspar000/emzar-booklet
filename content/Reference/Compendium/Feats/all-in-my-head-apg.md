# All In My Head  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 18*  
[bard](Reference/Rules/Traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [illusion](illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  

- **Trigger** You would take damage from a [Strike](strike.md) or spell that doesn't have the [death](death.md "Death Effect Trait") trait or otherwise cause instant death (such as [disintegrate](disintegrate.md)).
- **Activity** Reaction

Using your occult connections and incredible powers of persuasion, you convince yourself that the triggering damage is a figment of your imagination. The damage changes from its usual damage type to mental damage, and the damaging effect gains the [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") trait. You can't use this reaction if you are immune to [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects or mental damage.
