# Vernai Training  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Achaekek's Grip](achaekeks-grip-lol.md), [Advanced Red Mantis Magic](advanced-red-mantis-magic-lowg.md)

To resurrect a creature you've slain, a spellcaster must counteract your influence on its death. The DC of this check is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

In addition, add two 5th-level spells to your Red Mantis assassin spellbookâ€”both spells must be chosen from the following options: [death ward](death-ward.md), [drop dead](drop-dead.md), [false vision](false-vision.md), [hallucination](hallucination.md), [illusory scene](illusory-scene.md), [mind probe](mind-probe.md), or [sending](sending.md). You gain a 5th-level spell slot that you can use to prepare a spell from your Red Mantis assassin spellbook.
