# Barrier Shield  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [shield](shield.md)

When you cast [shield](shield.md), you can modify the spell to create a solid barrier you can use for cover, but not for blocking.

You can't use the [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md) reaction when the spell is modified in this way, but you (and only you) can spend an action to [Take Cover](take-cover.md) to gain standard cover from it.
