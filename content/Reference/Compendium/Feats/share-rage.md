# Share Rage  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  [visual](visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You haven't used this ability since you last Raged.
- **Activity** Single Action

You stoke an ally's fury. While you are raging, one willing creature within 30 feet gains the effects of the [Rage](Reference/Rules/Actions/rage.md) action, except it can still use [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") actions.

## Share Rage leads to...
