# Incredible Ricochet  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [fighter](Reference/Rules/Traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [press](press.md "Press Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Incredible Aim](incredible-aim.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

After your first shot singles out your opponent's position, you direct another that ricochets around obstacles and strikes unerringly. Make a ranged weapon [Strike](strike.md) against a creature you previously attacked this turn. You ignore the target's [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) condition and all cover.
