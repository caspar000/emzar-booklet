# Cast Down  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font or healing font
- **Activity** Single Action

The sheer force of your faith can bring a foe crashing down. If the next action you use is to cast [harm](harm.md) or [heal](heal.md) to damage one creature, the target is knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone) if it takes any damage from the spell. If the target critically fails its save against the spell, it also takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 minute.
