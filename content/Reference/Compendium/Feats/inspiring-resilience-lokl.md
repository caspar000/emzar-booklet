# Inspiring Resilience  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[bard](Reference/Rules/Traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Trigger** You and at least one other creature become the target of a spell or effect with the emotion, [fear](Reference/Rules/Traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait"), or [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") trait that allows a saving throw, and you haven't rolled the save yet.
- **Activity** Reaction

You show defiance in times of hardship and inspire your companions to persevere.

Allies within 30 feet of you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their Will save against the triggering effect, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the effect originated from an undead.
