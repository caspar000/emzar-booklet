# Elemental Explosion  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: elemental instinct
- **Requirements**: You're raging, and you haven't used this ability since you last Raged.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You unleash the energy roiling within you, exploding elemental matter in a 15-foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes `1d8` damage per level you possess, with the same type you chose for elemental rage.

Each creature in the area must attempt a basic Reflex save against your class DC. Elemental Explosion gains the trait of your element.
