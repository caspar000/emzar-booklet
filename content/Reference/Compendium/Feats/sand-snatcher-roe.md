# Sand Snatcher  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[earth](earth.md "Earth Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

A figure of sand with grasping arms arises in an unoccupied square within 30 feet. You can choose to make it Small or Medium size, and it can flank. When the sand snatcher appears, you can have it attempt to [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md) one creature adjacent to it that's no more than one size larger than it. This [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md) uses your impulse attack roll instead of an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check and shares your multiple attack penalty. The sand snatcher lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute. Each time you Sustain the impulse, you can have the sand snatcher either [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md) again or [Burrow](burrow.md), [Climb](climb.md), or [Stride](stride.md) up to 20 feet. Attempts to [Escape](escape.md) its grasp use your class DC.
