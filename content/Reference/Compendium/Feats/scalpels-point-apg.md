# Scalpel's Point  *Feat 4*  
[investigator](Reference/Rules/Traits/investigator-apg.md "Investigator Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: forensic medicine methodology

Your stratagems benefit from your precise knowledge of anatomy. When you critically hit with an attack on which you substituted your attack roll due to [Devising a Stratagem](devise-a-stratagem-apg.md), if your attack dealt piercing or slashing damage, you also deal `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to your target.
