# Ghost Hunter  *Feat 1*  
[duskwalker](duskwalker-apg.md "Duskwalker Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your connection to the Boneyard ensures that your blows strike true against spectral beings. Your weapon and unarmed attack [Strikes](strike.md) against incorporeal creatures become magical. If they are already magical, they instead gain the effects of a [ghost touch](ghost-touch.md) property rune.
