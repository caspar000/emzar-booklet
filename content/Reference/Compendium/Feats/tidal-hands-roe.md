- **Activity** Two-Action

With an emphatic gesture, you create waves that rush out from you in the shape of your hands. You either form two 15-foot cones that don't overlap or you combine the hands into one 30-foot cone. Each creature in a wave takes `1d8` bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. If a creature critically fails, you also push that creature 5 feet.
