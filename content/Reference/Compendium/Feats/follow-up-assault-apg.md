[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You used your previous action to make a melee [Strike](strike.md) that missed.
- **Activity** Single Action

Even in the face of failure you press the attack, determined to succeed. Make a [Strike](strike.md) with the same weapon, adding the effects of the [backswing](backswing.md "Backswing Weapon Trait") and [forceful](forceful.md "Forceful Weapon Trait") weapon traits.
