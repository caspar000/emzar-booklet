# Combat Premonition  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)

By narrowing your sense of the future, you can improve that of your allies. When you roll initiative, instead of stabilizing or destabilizing your own timestream, you can grant your allies a flash of insight into their future. Choose two allies. Those allies roll their initiative roll twice and take the better result; this is a [fortune](fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect. You roll your initiative roll twice and take the worse result; this is a [misfortune](misfortune.md "Misfortune Effect Trait") effect. The two effects are tied together: if you would avoid the [misfortune](misfortune.md "Misfortune Effect Trait") effect for any reason, or if any of your allies would negate their [fortune](fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect, your Combat Premonition does nothing.
