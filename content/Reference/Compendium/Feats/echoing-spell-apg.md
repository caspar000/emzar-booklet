# Echoing Spell  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 18*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [sorcerer](Reference/Rules/Traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You time the components of your spell with exacting precision, setting up a resonance that duplicates the spell's effects. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) of 4th level or lower that has no duration, the spell's energy reverberates and echoes. You can [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md) a second time before the end of your next turn without expending a spell slot.
