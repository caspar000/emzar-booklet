# Smoke Sight  *Feat 9*  
[dwarf](dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

You're used to fighting and hiding in a haze of smoke and flame. You automatically succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) creature if that creature is [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) only by smoke. When you are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) in smoke, increase the DC of the flat check to target you to 6 if you're [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) or 12 if you're [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden).
