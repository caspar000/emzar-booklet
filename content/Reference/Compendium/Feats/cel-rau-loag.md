# Cel Rau  *Feat 1*  
[dhampir](dhampir-b1.md "Dhampir Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [lineage](lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  


You are a cel rau, child of a strigoi, one of the first vampires to walk Golarion. Your heritage ties you to the Shadow Plane and grants you strange resilience to light and darkness alike. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects with the [darkness](Reference/Rules/Traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait"), [light](Reference/Rules/Traits/light.md "Light Effect Trait"), or [shadow](Reference/Rules/Traits/shadow.md "Shadow General Trait") traits, and whenever you become [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) or [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) for at least 2 rounds, you can reduce the duration by 1 round.

## Cel Rau leads to...
