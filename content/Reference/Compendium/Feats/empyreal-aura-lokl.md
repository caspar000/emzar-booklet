- **Prerequisites**: Knight Vigilant, legendary in [Religion](skills.md#Religion)

As an ultimate foe of evil and protector of the innocent, your very presence is a ward against evil. Each evil creature within 30 feet of you at the end of your turn must succeed at a Will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or else become [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) ([slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) on a critical failure). On a successful save, the creature is temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
