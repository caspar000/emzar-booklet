# Scorching Disarm  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 9*  
[fire](fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [ifrit](ifrit-b2.md "Ifrit Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You make a weapon unbearable to hold. Attempt an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](Reference/Rules/Actions/disarm.md) a target creature. You don't need to have a hand free to make this [Disarm](Reference/Rules/Actions/disarm.md) attempt. If the [Disarm](Reference/Rules/Actions/disarm.md) attempt succeeds, the target takes `4d6` fire damage unless it drops the weapon, and on a critical success, it takes `4d6` fire damage and drops the weapon. If you're legendary in [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics), this increases to `8d6` fire damage.
