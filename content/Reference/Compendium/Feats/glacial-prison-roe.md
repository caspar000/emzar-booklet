# Glacial Prison  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[cold](cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [incapacitation](incapacitation.md "Incapacitation Effect Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [overflow](overflow-roe.md "Overflow Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Intense cold swirls around your foe, covering it in frost that slows it down and turns its body to ice. Target a creature you can observe within 120 feet. It must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of its next turn.
> - **Failure** The target is frozen solid. It can't act, its AC is 9, it has Hardness 5, and it's immune to other [cold](cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait") effects, critical hits, and precision damage. This lasts until the end of your next turn, but if the target is affected by a [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) action, this effect ends immediately after that action.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but after becoming unfrozen, the creature is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of its next turn.
