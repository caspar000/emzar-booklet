# Drifting Pollen  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [plant](plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  [wood](wood-roe.md "Wood Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

A haze of pollen floats around you. A creature in your kinetic aura when you enter the stance, or who later enters the aura or ends its turn in the aura, attempts at a Fortitude save against your class DC. On a failure, it's [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened) ([sickened](conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical failure) and [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) until it's no longer [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened). A creature attempts this save no more than once per round and doesn't attempt a new save if already affected.
