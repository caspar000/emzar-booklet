# Elaborate Flourish  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [sorcerer](Reference/Rules/Traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You embellish your spellcasting with entrancing flourishes and grand pronouncements, making it harder to identify or counter. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md), creatures with the ability to [Cast that Spell](cast-a-spell.md) don't automatically know what the spell is. In addition, creatures that witness your spellcasting take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to checks to identify the spell with [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) and checks to counteract the spell during its casting (such as with Counterspell).
