# Mixed Maneuver  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[monk](Reference/Rules/Traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You combine two different maneuvers together into a single flowing whole. Choose any two of [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md), [Shove](Reference/Rules/Actions/shove.md), and [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md). Attempt both of the attacks you chose against the same or different creatures, but don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after resolving both attacks.
