- **Activity** Single Action

You've learned to reload your simple firearms with uncanny grace, the ammunition simply falling into place as though part of a well-practiced kata. You [Strike](strike.md) with a simple firearm, and then [Interact](interact.md) to reload that same firearm. You don't need a free hand to reload your simple firearm in this way.
