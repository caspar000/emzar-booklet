# Stumbling Stance  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](Reference/Rules/Traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](skills.md#Deception)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the movements of the inebriatedâ€”bobbing, weaving, leaving false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true movements. While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Deception](skills.md#Deception) checks to [Feint](feint.md). The only [Strikes](strike.md) you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal `1d8` bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait"), [backstabber](backstabber.md "Backstabber Weapon Trait"), [finesse](finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait"), [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits. If an enemy hits you with a melee [Strike](strike.md) while in this stance, it becomes [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the next stumbling swing [Strike](strike.md) you make against it before the end of your next turn.
