# Morph-Risen  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  [reflection](reflection-da.md "Reflection Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You were once a shapeshifter or spellcaster using polymorph magic, but something went wrong, and you became trapped in the form of the creature you were imitating. This accident might have [drained](conditions.md#Drained) your power, or you might have retained some of your skills, but either way, your form resists further forced transformation. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait") effects, and if you roll a success on a saving throw against a [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) [morph](morph.md "Morph Effect Trait") or [polymorph](polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") effect, you get a critical success instead.

## Morph-Risen leads to...
