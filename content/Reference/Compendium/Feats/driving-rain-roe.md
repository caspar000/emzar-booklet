# Driving Rain  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 6*  
[impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [overflow](overflow-roe.md "Overflow Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Activity** Three-Action

Heavy drops of rain batter down, hitting like sling stones and impeding vision. Each creature in a 15-foot burst within 120 feet takes `3d8` bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. Until the start of your next turn, all creatures are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) while in the area, and all creatures outside the area are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures within it.
