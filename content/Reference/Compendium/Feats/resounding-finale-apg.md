# Resounding Finale  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 16*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [bard](Reference/Rules/Traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: maestro muse
- **Trigger** You or an ally benefiting from your composition spell would take sonic damage.
- **Activity** Reaction

You bring your performance to a sudden, dramatic finish, drowning out other sounds. Your composition spell ends immediately, and all allies that had been benefiting from the spell's effects gain sonic resistance against the triggering damage equal to twice the composition spell's level.
