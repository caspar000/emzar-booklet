# Elemental Embellish  *Feat 1*  
[suli](suli-b2.md "Suli Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You can summon a harmless but impressive elemental display. You become trained in [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation). If you would automatically become trained in [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

When you [Demoralize](demoralize.md) a foe, if you choose to [Demoralize](demoralize.md) via an elemental display, [Demoralize](demoralize.md) loses the [auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") trait and gains the [visual](visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to [Demoralize](demoralize.md) a creature that doesn't understand your language.
