# Feathered Cloak  *Feat 5*  
[strix](strix-loag.md "Strix Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


To blend in with the grounded and wingless, you fold your wings just so on your back, creating the illusion of a feathered cloak. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to [Deception](skills.md#Deception) checks to [Impersonate](impersonate.md) a version of yourself who is not a strix.

Additionally, your folded wings help you obscure objects on your person, providing a +2 circumstance bonus to [Stealth](skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Conceal an Object](conceal-an-object.md).
