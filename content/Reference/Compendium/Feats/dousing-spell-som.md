# Dousing Spell  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](elementalist-dedication-som.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enhance your spell with elemental water, soaking the target. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) targeting a single creature, you soak the target of the spell with water.

If the target has [persistent acid](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) or fire damage, the DC to end those conditions is reduced to 10, and the creature can attempt a flat check to end those types of [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) immediately. The spell gains the [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait (causing it to deal extra damage to creatures with weakness to water).
