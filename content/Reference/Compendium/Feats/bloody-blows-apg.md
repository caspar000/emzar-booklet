# Bloody Blows  *Feat 5*  
[orc](orc.md "Orc Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your lethal unarmed attacks leave bloody gouges or cause severe internal bleeding. When you critically hit with a [Strike](strike.md) using an unarmed attack that isn't [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), the target takes `1d4` [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). This can be because you're taking the penalty to use a fist for a lethal attack or because you have an unarmed attack without the [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait") trait due to [Iron Fists](iron-fists-apg.md), [Tusks](tusks-apg.md), or a similar ability.
