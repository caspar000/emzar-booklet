# Defy The Darkness  *Feat 5*  
[dwarf](dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: darkvision

Using ancient dwarven methods developed to fight enemies wielding magical darkness, you've honed your [darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md) and sworn not to use such magic yourself. You gain [greater darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md), enabling you to see through magical darkness even if it normally hampers [darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md) (such as the darkness created by a 4th-level [darkness](Reference/Compendium/Spells/darkness.md) spell). You can't cast spells with the [darkness](Reference/Rules/Traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait") trait, use item activations with the [darkness](Reference/Rules/Traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait") trait, or use any other ability with the [darkness](Reference/Rules/Traits/darkness.md "Darkness Effect Trait") trait.
