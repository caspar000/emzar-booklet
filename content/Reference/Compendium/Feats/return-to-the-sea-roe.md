# Return to the Sea  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [morph](morph.md "Morph Effect Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You adapt a creature to living and moving in water. Target a willing creature within 30 feet. For 10 minutes, it gains the effects of a [feet to fins](feet-to-fins.md) spell, can breathe water, and gets a +1 status bonus to AC and saves against any creature with the amphibious, [aquatic](aquatic-b1.md "Aquatic Creature Trait"), or [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") trait. In addition, its attacks ignore the effects water normally has on bludgeoning and slashing attacks. If you use Return to the Sea again, any existing one ends.
