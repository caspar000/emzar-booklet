# Ever-vigilant Senses  *Feat 16*  
[evolution](evolution-som.md "Evolution Feat Trait")  [summoner](Reference/Rules/Traits/summoner-som.md "Summoner Class Trait")  


Your eidolon has enhanced senses. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](skills.md#Perception), and can't be flanked except by creatures that are higher level than it. It can see [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) creatures and objects; they appear translucent and are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed). When your eidolon moves within 30 feet of an illusion that can be 0, the GM rolls a secret check to 0 it, even if your eidolon didn't spend an action to [Interact](interact.md).
