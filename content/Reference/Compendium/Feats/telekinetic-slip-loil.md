# Telekinetic Slip  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 9*  
[evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [kashrishi](kashrishi-loil.md "Kashrishi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** Your turn begins, and you're [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Reaction

A thin shell of telekinetic energy pushes from your skin, widening your enemy's grasp enough for you to slip free. You gain a +2 status bonus to checks to [Escape](escape.md) from whatever has you [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained). This bonus lasts until either you're no longer [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained), or you fall [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious).
