# Pushing Attack  *Feat 10*  
[evolution](evolution-som.md "Evolution Feat Trait")  [summoner](Reference/Rules/Traits/summoner-som.md "Summoner Class Trait")  


Your eidolon has an attack that pushes away enemies.

Choose one of the eidolon's unarmed attacks with the [shove](Reference/Rules/Traits/shove.md "Shove Weapon Trait") trait. It gains the [Push](push.md) action for that attack.
