# Magic Sense (Sorcerer)  *Feat 12*  
[detection](detection.md "Detection Effect Trait")  [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [sorcerer](Reference/Rules/Traits/sorcerer.md "Sorcerer Class Trait")  


You have a literal sixth sense for magic. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level [detect magic](Reference/Compendium/Spells/detect-magic.md) spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you [Seek](seek.md), you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level [detect magic](Reference/Compendium/Spells/detect-magic.md) spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of [Seeking](seek.md)). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.

**Special.** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast ([arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), natural, or [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")).
