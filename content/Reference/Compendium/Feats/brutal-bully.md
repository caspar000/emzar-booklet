[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics)

You push your foes around and leave bruises. While raging, when you successfully [Disarm](Reference/Rules/Actions/disarm.md), [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md), [Shove](Reference/Rules/Actions/shove.md), or [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md) a foe, you deal that foe bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier; add this to the damage from a critical success to [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md).
