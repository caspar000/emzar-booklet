# Winter Sleet  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[cold](cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

Bone-chilling, swirling sleet surrounds you, cruel as deepest winter. Surfaces in your kinetic aura are coated in slippery ice. A creature that moves on this uneven ground immediately falls unless it Balances (DC 15). A creature is off-guard on the ice, as normal for uneven ground. You're immune to these effects.

If a creature on the ice is critically hit by one of your water impulses or critically fails at a save against one, that creature is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of its next turn.
