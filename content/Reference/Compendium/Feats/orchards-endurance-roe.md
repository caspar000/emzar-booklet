[impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [plant](plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  [wood](wood-roe.md "Wood Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

Patches of bark appear on the skin of you and your nearby allies. You and your allies in your kinetic aura gain resistance 5 to bludgeoning and piercing damage. In addition, you and your affected allies roll flat checks to recover from [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) twice and take the higher result; this is a [fortune](fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait") effect.
