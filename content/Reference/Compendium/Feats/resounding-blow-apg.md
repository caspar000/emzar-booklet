# Resounding Blow  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a melee weapon that deals bludgeoning damage.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You strike your enemy in the head with such force that their ears ring. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md). If the [Strike](strike.md) hits and deals damage, the target is [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened) until the start of your next turn (or for 1 minute on a critical hit).
