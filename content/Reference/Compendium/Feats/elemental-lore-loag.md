# Elemental Lore  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](ifrit-b2.md "Ifrit Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [oread](oread-b2.md "Oread Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [suli](suli-b2.md "Suli Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [sylph](sylph-b2.md "Sylph Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [undine](undine-b2.md "Undine Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You've devoted yourself to researching the secrets of the Inner Sphere. You gain the trained proficiency in your choice of [Survival](skills.md#Survival) and either [Arcana](skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in [Survival](skills.md#Survival) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in the [Lore](skills.md#Lore) associated with your Elemental Plane of origin (such as Plane of [Fire Lore](skills.md#Lore)).
