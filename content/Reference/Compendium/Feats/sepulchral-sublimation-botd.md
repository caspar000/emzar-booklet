# Sepulchral Sublimation  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  [necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [oracle](Reference/Rules/Traits/oracle-apg.md "Oracle Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [wizard](Reference/Rules/Traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to permanently create or control undead;  cleric with a negative font, oracle of bones, or necromancer wizard
- **Requirements**: You have at least one undead minion that you permanently control.
- **Activity** Single Action

You repurpose the negative energy that flows through your minions at a moment's notice. Instantly destroy one undead minion within 60 feet that is permanently under your control. If your next action is to cast a necromancy spell from a spell slot, you don't expend the slot. The spell's level must be half the destroyed minion's level or lower and the spell can't have a duration.

**Special.** This feat has the trait matching your spellcasting tradition.
