# Metamagic Channel  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 20*  
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  

- **Activity** Free Action

Deep understanding of divine revelations into the nature of vital essence allows you to freely manipulate the effects of your positive or negative energy. Use 1 [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait") action that you can perform that normally takes 1 action and can be applied to the [harm](harm.md) or [heal](heal.md) spell. If you use it in this way, its effects apply only to a [harm](harm.md) or [heal](heal.md) spell.
