- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Activity** Single Action

You menace the target, stoking their fears and drawing their attention. Attempt an [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation) check against the Will DC of a target within 30 feet. If you succeed, for 1 minute, that target gains a +2 status bonus to [Perception](skills.md#Perception) checks against you, but they take a â€“2 status penalty to Will saves against [fear](Reference/Rules/Traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait") effects.
