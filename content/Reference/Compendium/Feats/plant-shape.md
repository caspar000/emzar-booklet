# Plant Shape  *Feat 10*  
[druid](Reference/Rules/Traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Leaf order or [Wild Shape](Reference/Compendium/Feats/wild-shape.md)

You can take the form of a plant creature. Add the forms listed in plant form to your wild shape list; if you don't have wild shape, you can instead cast [plant form](plant-form.md) once per day, heightened to the highest spell level you can cast. Whenever you're polymorphed into another form using wild shape, you gain resistance 5 to poison.
