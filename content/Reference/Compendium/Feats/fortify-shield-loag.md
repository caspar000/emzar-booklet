- **Prerequisites**: [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md)

You reinforce your shield with a rocky outgrowth of metal and stone. You Raise your Shield. If you use the [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md) reaction before your next turn, add your character level to your shield's Hardness when determining how much damage is blocked.
