- **Activity** Two-Action

A floating metal ball forms in a space within 30 feet, flashing with electricity. It can't be targeted or damaged. Any of your allies adjacent to it gain resistance to electricity equal to your level and add the shock rune to all their Strikes with metal objects. The sphere lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. When you conjure the sphere and the first time you Sustain the impulse on subsequent rounds, you can either have it [Fly](Reference/Rules/Actions/fly.md) up to 20 feet or deal `1d12` electricity damage to an adjacent creature with a basic Reflex save against your class DC.
