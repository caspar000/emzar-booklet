- **Activity** Two-Action

You form water and earth into a mudslide that smashes your opponents and coats them in mud. Each creature in the area takes `2d8` bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC. A creature that fails is also pushed 5 feet (or 10 feet on a critical failure) and coated in mud until the end of its next turn. While coated in mud, the creature falls [prone](conditions.md#Prone) at the end of its movement any time it ends a move action other than a [Crawl](crawl.md) or [Step](step.md). The creature can attempt an [Acrobatics](skills.md#Acrobatics) check or Reflex save against your class DC, avoiding the fall if it succeeds.
