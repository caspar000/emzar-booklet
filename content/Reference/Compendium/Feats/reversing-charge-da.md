[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You dive into the fray before rewinding yourself to safety. [Stride](stride.md) up to your Speed. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against that enemy. You then teleport back to the square from which you began your Reversing Charge. You can use Reversing Charge while [Burrowing](burrow.md), [Climbing](climb.md), [Flying](Reference/Rules/Actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](swim.md) instead of [Striding](stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
