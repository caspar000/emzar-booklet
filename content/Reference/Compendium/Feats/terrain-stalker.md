# Terrain Stalker  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Stealth](skills.md#Stealth)

Select one type of difficult terrain from the following list: rubble, snow, or underbrush. While [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) by all non-allies in that type of terrain, you can [Sneak](sneak.md) without attempting a [Stealth](skills.md#Stealth) check as long as you move no more than 5 feet and do not move within 10 feet of an enemy at any point during your movement. This also allows you to automatically approach creatures to within 15 feet while [Avoiding Notice](avoid-notice.md) during exploration as long as they aren't actively [Searching](search.md) or on guard.

**Special.** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, choose a different type of terrain.
