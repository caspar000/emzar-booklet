# Moment Of Clarity  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You push back your rage for a moment in order to think clearly. Until the end of this turn, you can use actions with the [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait even if those actions don't have the [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait") trait.
