# Dragon Roar  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait")  [fear](Reference/Rules/Traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [monk](Reference/Rules/Traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dragon Stance](dragon-stance.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Dragon Stance.
- **Activity** Single Action

You bellow, instilling fear in your enemies. Enemies within a 15-foot emanation must succeed at a Will save against your [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation) DC or be [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) ([frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical failure). When a creature [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) by the roar begins its turn adjacent to you, it can't reduce its [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) value below 1 on that turn. Your first attack that hits a [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) creature after you roar and before the end of your next turn gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage.

After you use Dragon Roar, you can't use it again for `1d4` rounds. Its effects end immediately if you leave Dragon Stance. Creatures in the area of your roar are then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
