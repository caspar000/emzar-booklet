# Shattering Strike  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 16*  
[monk](Reference/Rules/Traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

The force of your considered blow shatters objects and defenses alike. Make an unarmed [Strike](strike.md). It bypasses the target's resistances. If the target has Hardness, the [Strike](strike.md) treats the Hardness as if it were half its value.
