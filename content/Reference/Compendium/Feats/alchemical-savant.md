# Alchemical Savant  *Feat 1*  
[alchemist](Reference/Rules/Traits/alchemist.md "Alchemist Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting)

You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting) skill to [Identify Alchemy](identify-alchemy.md) on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action, which has the [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") and [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") traits, instead of spending 10 minutes. If you have the formula for the item you are attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check, and if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
