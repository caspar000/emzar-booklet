# Mobility  *Feat 2*  
[rogue](Reference/Rules/Traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  


You move in a way that denies your enemies the opportunity to retaliate. When you take a [Stride](stride.md) action to move half your Speed or less, that movement does not trigger reactions. You can use Mobility when [Climbing](climb.md), [Flying](Reference/Rules/Actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](swim.md) instead of [Striding](stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
