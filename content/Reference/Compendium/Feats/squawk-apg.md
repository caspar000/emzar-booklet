# Squawk!  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[tengu](tengu-b1.md "Tengu Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Trigger** You critically fail a [Deception](skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy), or [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation) check against a creature that doesn't have the [tengu](tengu-b1.md "Tengu Ancestry & Heritage Trait") trait.
- **Activity** Reaction

You let out an awkward squawk, ruffle your feathers, or fake some other birdlike tic to cover up a social misstep or faux pas. You get a failure on the triggering check, rather than a critical failure. All creatures that witnessed you Squawk are temporarily immune for 24 hours.
