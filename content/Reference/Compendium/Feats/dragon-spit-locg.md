# Dragon Spit  *Feat 1*  
[human](human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Tian-Dan ethnicity

Many Tian-Dan claim to have dragon blood in their veins, and in your case, this is trueâ€”you can spit energy, and you might have an especially visible sign of your draconic heritage. Choose one of the following cantrips: [acid splash](acid-splash.md), [electric arc](electric-arc.md), [produce flame](produce-flame.md), or [ray of frost](ray-of-frost.md). You can cast this spell as an innate arcane spell at will, and when you cast it, the spell's energy emerges from your mouth.
