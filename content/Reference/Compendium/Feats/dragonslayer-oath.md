# Dragonslayer Oath  *Feat 2*  
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [oath](oath.md "Oath Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good

You've sworn to slay evil dragons. Add the following tenet to your code after the others: "You must slay evil dragons you encounter as long as you have a reasonable chance of success."

Your [Retributive Strike](Reference/Rules/Actions/retributive-strike.md) gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against an evil dragon, or +6 if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used. Your [Glimpse of Redemption](glimpse-of-redemption.md)'s resistance against damage from an evil dragon is 7 + your level. If you use [Liberating Step](liberating-step.md) triggered by an evil dragon, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your [Liberating Step](liberating-step.md), and the ally can [Step](step.md) twice afterward.

You don't consider evil dragons to be legitimate authorities, even in nations they rule.
