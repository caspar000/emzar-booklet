# Scout's Warning (Ranger)  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 4*  
[ranger](Reference/Rules/Traits/ranger.md "Ranger Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** You are about to roll a [Perception](skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](skills.md#Survival) check for initiative.
- **Activity** Free Action

You visually or audibly warn your allies of danger, granting them each a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls. Depending on whether you use gestures or call out, this action gains either the [visual](visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") or the [auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") trait, respectively.
