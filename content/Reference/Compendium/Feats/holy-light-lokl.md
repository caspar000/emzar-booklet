- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Prerequisites**: you follow a good-aligned deity
- **Activity** Two-Action

You raise your arms to the sky and pray fervently, surrounding yourself in a beacon of holy light. The beacon sheds bright light in a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on you until the beginning of your next turn. Evil creatures in the area must succeed at a Will save equal to your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) or become [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.
