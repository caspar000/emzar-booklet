# Tide-hardened  *Feat 1*  
[undine](undine-b2.md "Undine Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You're at home in the unpredictable tides. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [cold](cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait") and [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") effects. If you roll a success on a save against a [cold](cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait") or [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait") effect, you get a critical success instead.
