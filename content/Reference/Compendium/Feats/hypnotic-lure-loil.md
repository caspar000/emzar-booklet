- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Two-Action

Your unblinking gaze is so intense it can befuddle the mind of others, drawing your victims toward you even against their better judgment. You stare at a creature within 30 feet. The target must attempt a Will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** On its turn, the target must spend its first action to approach you. It can't [Delay](delay.md) or take reactions until it has done so.
> - **Critical Failure** The target must use all its actions on its next turn to approach you. It can't [Delay](delay.md) or take any reactions until it has reached a space that's adjacent to you (or as close to you as possible if it reaches an impassable barrier).
