# Raging Intimidation  *Feat 1*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  


Your fury fills your foes with fear. While you are raging, your [Demoralize](demoralize.md) and [Scare to Death](scare-to-death.md) actions (from the [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation) skill and an [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation) skill feat, respectively) gain the [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait") trait, allowing you to use them while raging. As soon as you meet the prerequisites for the skill feats [Intimidating Glare](intimidating-glare.md) and [Scare to Death](scare-to-death.md), you gain these feats.
