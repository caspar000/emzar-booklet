# Subtle Theft  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Thievery](skills.md#Thievery)

When you successfully [Steal](steal.md) something, observers (creatures other than the creature you stole from) take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to their [Perception](skills.md#Perception) DCs to detect your theft. Additionally, if you first [Create a Diversion](create-a-diversion.md) using [Deception](skills.md#Deception), taking a single [Palm an Object](palm-an-object.md) or [Steal](steal.md) action doesn't end your [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) condition.
