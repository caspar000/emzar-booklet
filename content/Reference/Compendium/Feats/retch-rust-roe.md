- **Activity** Two-Action

You exhale tendrils formed from flakes of rusted metal. All creatures in a 30-foot cone take `4d10` slashing damage with a basic Fortitude save against your class DC. A metal creature that fails its save also takes `2d4` [persistent slashing damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

Heightened (+2) The cloud's slashing damage increases by `1d10` and the [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by `1d4`.
