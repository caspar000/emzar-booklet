# No Escape  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 2*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Trigger** A foe within reach attempts to move away from you.
- **Activity** Reaction

You keep pace with a retreating foe. [Stride](stride.md) up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you've moved your full Speed. You can use No Escape to [Burrow](burrow.md), [Climb](climb.md), [Fly](Reference/Rules/Actions/fly.md), or [Swim](swim.md) instead of [Stride](stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
