# Channeled Succor  *Feat 8*  
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: healing font

You can remove conditions with divine grace. You can sacrifice one [heal](heal.md) spell you've prepared in your extra slots from healing font to cast one of the following spells instead: [remove curse](remove-curse.md), [remove disease](remove-disease.md), [remove paralysis](remove-paralysis.md), or [restoration](restoration.md). The spell is heightened to the same level as the [heal](heal.md) spell you sacrificed.
