# Channel Smite  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font or healing font
- **Cost**: Expend a [harm](harm.md) or [heal](heal.md) spell.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You siphon the destructive energies of positive or negative energy through a melee attack and into your foe. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) and add the spell's damage to the [Strike](strike.md)'s damage. This is negative damage if you expended a [harm](harm.md) spell or positive damage if you expended a [heal](heal.md) spell. The spell is expended with no effect if your [Strike](strike.md) fails or hits a creature that isn't damaged by that energy type (such as if you hit a non-undead creature with a [heal](heal.md) spell).
