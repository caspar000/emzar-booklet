# Shard Strike  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 1*  
[impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [metal](metal-roe.md "Metal Energy & Element Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Jagged metal shards form in the air and lash out from you. You choose shards or spines, which changes the area, damage type, and critical failure effect. Each creature in the area attempts a basic Reflex save against your class DC. Shards deal `1d6` slashing damage in a 15-foot cone, and a creature that critically fails takes `1d6` [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). Spines deal `1d6` piercing damage in a 30-foot line, and a creature that critically fails is [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) until the start of your next turn.
