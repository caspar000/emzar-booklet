# Dragon Stance  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](Reference/Rules/Traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of a dragon and make powerful leg strikes like a lashing dragon's tail. You can make dragon tail attacks that deal `1d10` bludgeoning damage. They are in the brawling group and have the [backswing](backswing.md "Backswing Weapon Trait"), [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits.

While in Dragon Stance, you can ignore the first square of difficult terrain while [Striding](stride.md).

## Dragon Stance leads to...

[Dragon Roar](dragon-roar.md)
