# Triggerbrand Blitz  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 14*  
[gunslinger](Reference/Rules/Traits/gunslinger-g-g.md "Gunslinger Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: way of the triggerbrand
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a combination weapon.
- **Activity** Three-Action

You dance through your foes, stabbing and shooting. You [Stride](stride.md), making up to three Strikes with your combination weapon at any point during your movement, each against a different target. You can make any combination of melee and ranged attacks without needing to change modes to do so, though typically you can't make more than one ranged attack because of the need to reload. This counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after making all three attacks.

After using Triggerbrand Blitz, you become [fatigued](conditions.md#Fatigued) for 1 minute.
