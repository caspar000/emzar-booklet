# Target of Psychic Ire  *Feat 16*  
[amp](amp-da.md "Amp Feat Trait")  [evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  [psychic](Reference/Rules/Traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  


Your magic saturates your surroundings with hateful psychic energy. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The cantrip must be one that takes 2 or more actions to cast and targets a creature.
