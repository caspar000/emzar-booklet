# Rope Runner  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pirate Dedication](pirate-dedication-apg.md); trained in [Acrobatics](skills.md#Acrobatics) and [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics)

You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only on ship's rigging or similar ropes. Whenever you succeed at an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [Climb](climb.md) a rope or an [Acrobatics](skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Balance](balance.md) on a rope, you get a critical success instead. You aren't [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) while [Climbing](climb.md) or [Balancing](balance.md) on a rope.
