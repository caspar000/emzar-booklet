# Hydraulic Maneuvers  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 13*  
[azarketi](azarketi-loag.md "Azarketi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You batter your foes with a torrent of water siphoned from your surroundings. If the next action you take is an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](Reference/Rules/Actions/disarm.md), [Shove](Reference/Rules/Actions/shove.md), or [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md), that action has a range of 15 feet. You don't receive any item bonuses to that check or any circumstance bonuses related to your physical body, but if you roll a critical failure on that [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check, you get a failure instead.
