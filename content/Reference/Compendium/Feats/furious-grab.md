# Furious Grab  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: Your last action was a successful [Strike](strike.md), and either you have a hand free or your [Strike](strike.md) used a [grapple](Reference/Rules/Traits/grapple.md "Grapple Weapon Trait") weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You grab your foe while it's distracted by your attack. The foe you hit becomes [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed), as if you had succeeded at an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md) the foe.
