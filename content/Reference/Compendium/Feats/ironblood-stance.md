- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of impenetrable iron, refusing to yield to any blow. You can make iron sweep unarmed attacks. These deal `1d8` bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), [parry](parry.md "Parry Weapon Trait"), [sweep](sweep.md "Sweep Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits.

While in Ironblood Stance, you gain resistance 2 to all damage. The resistance increases to 3 at 12th level, to 4 at 16th level, and to 5 at 20th level.
