A burst of light from your horn cleanses your allies of ailments and sends your foes reeling. You and all allies in a 20-foot emanation benefit from a 4th-level [restoration](restoration.md) spell. All enemies within the emanation are [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) until the end of your next turn.
