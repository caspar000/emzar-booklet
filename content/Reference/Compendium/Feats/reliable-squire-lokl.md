[bard](Reference/Rules/Traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.

You know the path to victory isn't traveled alone, and you lend aid to your companions whenever you can. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [Aid](aid.md). If you roll a critical failure on a check to [Aid](aid.md), you get a failure instead.
