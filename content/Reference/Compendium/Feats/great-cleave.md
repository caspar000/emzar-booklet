# Great Cleave  *Feat 10*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cleave](cleave.md)

Your fury carries your weapon through multiple foes. When you Cleave, if your [Strike](strike.md) also kills or knocks the target [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious), you can continue to make melee [Strikes](strike.md) until you make a [Strike](strike.md) that doesn't kill or knock a creature [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious), or until there are no creatures adjacent to the most recent creature you attacked while Cleaving, whichever comes first.
