# Supernatural Senses  *Feat 4*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acute Scent](acute-scent.md) or precise or imprecise [scent](scent.md)

Your [scent](scent.md) is preternaturally sharp, and you can always rely on your sense of smell to help guide you when your vision is compromised. When you target a [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) opponent while you are [raging](Reference/Rules/Actions/rage.md), you reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) target or to 9 for a [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) one.
