# Nocturnal Sense  *Feat 6*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acute Scent](acute-scent.md), or precise or imprecise [scent](scent.md) and [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md)

Your senses gain even greater clarity. While [raging](Reference/Rules/Actions/rage.md), you gain [darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md) if you don't already have it, and the range of your imprecise [scent](scent.md) increases to 60 feet.
