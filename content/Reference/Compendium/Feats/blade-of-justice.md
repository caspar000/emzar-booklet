# Blade Of Justice  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good
- **Activity** Two-Action

You call upon divine power and make a weapon or unarmed [Strike](strike.md) against a foe you have witnessed harming an ally or innocent. The [Strike](strike.md) deals two extra weapon damage dice if the target of your [Strike](strike.md) is evil. Whether or not the target is [evil](evil.md "Evil Alignment Trait"), you can convert all the physical damage from the attack into good damage, and if you are a paladin, the [Strike](strike.md) applies all effects that normally apply on a [Retributive Strike](Reference/Rules/Actions/retributive-strike.md) (such as divine smite|Champion||Paladin||9).
