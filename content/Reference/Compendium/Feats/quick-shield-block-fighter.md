# Quick Shield Block (Fighter)  *Feat 8*  
[fighter](Reference/Rules/Traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md)

You can bring your shield into place with hardly a thought. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md).
