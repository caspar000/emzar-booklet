# Fiendish Mount  *Feat 20*  
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (steed), tenets of evil

Your steed ally manifests a suite of powerful and sinister gifts granted to it by your deity. It gains [darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md), its maximum Hit Points increase by 40, and it gains weakness 10 to good damage.

Additionally, it grows wings appropriate for a servitor of your deity (such as bat wings for a devil), granting it a fly Speed equal to its Speed. It gains the [fiend](fiend.md "Fiend Creature Type Trait") trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor it has become (such as daemon, demon, or devil).
