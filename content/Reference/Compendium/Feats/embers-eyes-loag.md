# Ember's Eyes  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](ifrit-b2.md "Ifrit Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your eyes blaze with inner flame. You gain [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md), or you gain [darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md) if your ancestry already has [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md).

**Special.** If your ancestry has neither [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md) nor [darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md), you can take this ancestry feat a second time to gain [darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md). You can't retrain out of this feat.
