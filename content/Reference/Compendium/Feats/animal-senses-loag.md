# Animal Senses  *Feat 1*  
[beastkin](beastkin-loag.md "Beastkin Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You gain one of the following senses available to your inherent animal: [darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md), [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md), or [scent](scent.md) (imprecise) 30 feet. You must have [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md) before you can gain [darkvision](Reference/Rules/Abilities/darkvision.md) with this feat. If your inherent animal doesn't typically have a specific type of sense, you can't gain that sense with this feat.

**Special.** You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different sense each time.
