- **Prerequisites**: your eidolon is a phantom
- **Activity** Three-Action

Your eidolon phases out of reality slightly, gaining resistance to all damage (except force and negative) equal to half your level. It's not incorporeal, but it can't use [Strikes](strike.md) or actions that require a fully physical form, such as [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md), [Shove](Reference/Rules/Actions/shove.md), or [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md). Your eidolon can return to its normal form with a single action, which has the [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait.
