# Knockback Strike  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [monk](Reference/Rules/Traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You focus your strength into a blow powerful enough to push an enemy away from you. Make an unarmed [Strike](strike.md). If you hit, attempt an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [Shove](Reference/Rules/Actions/shove.md) the target. This attack uses the same multiple attack penalty as your [Strike](strike.md), and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.
