# Mental Static  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait")  [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  [psychic](Reference/Rules/Traits/psychic-da.md "Psychic Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** You roll a critical success on a Will save against a [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect from a creature.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your thoughts sting back when a lesser mind tries to invade your own. You deal mental damage equal to your level to the triggering creature. If you so desire, you can also send the creature a single mental image to coincide with the damage, such as a watchful eye or the dread of floating in an infinite sea.
