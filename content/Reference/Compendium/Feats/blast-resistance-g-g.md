# Blast Resistance  *Feat 5*  
[dwarf](dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

You're used to the clamor of steel, the crack of a firearm, and the thunderous blast of explosions. You gain resistance 3 to sonic. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an [auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") effect that causes the [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened) condition, you get a critical success instead.
