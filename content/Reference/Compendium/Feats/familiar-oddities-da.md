# Familiar Oddities  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [skill](skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Curse Maelstrom Dedication](curse-maelstrom-dedication-da.md), trained in [Occultism](skills.md#Occultism) or [Curse Lore](skills.md#Lore)

Perhaps due to the curse within you, curses occasionally perceive you as an extension of themselves and readily reveal themselves to you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [Identify Magic](identify-magic.md) on a cursed item or a spell that has the [curse](curse.md "Curse Effect Trait") trait.
