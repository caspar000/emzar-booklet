# Bizarre Transformation  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[druid](Reference/Rules/Traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Wild Shape
- **Activity** Single Action

The forms you take on defy beliefâ€”chimerical sights of twisted antlers or acidic drool. If your next action is to cast [wild shape](Reference/Compendium/Spells/wild-shape.md), you can change the damage type of a single unarmed attack granted by the wild shape form to one of the following: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, poison, piercing, or slashing.

The chosen attack gains the appropriate trait.
