# Necrotic Infusion  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font, evil alignment
- **Activity** Single Action

You pour negative energy into your undead subject to empower its attacks. If the next action you use is to cast [harm](harm.md) to restore Hit Points to a single undead creature, the target then deals an additional `1d6` negative damage with its melee weapons and unarmed attacks until the end of its next turn. If the [harm](harm.md) spell is at least 5th level, this damage increases to `2d6`, and if the [harm](harm.md) spell is at least 8th level, the damage increases to `3d6`.
