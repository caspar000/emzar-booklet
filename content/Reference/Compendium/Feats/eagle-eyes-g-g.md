[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [visual](visual.md "Visual Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)

You and your spotter are adept at watching out for one another. As long as you can see or hear each other, neither of you is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) to [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden), [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected), or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or to creatures of your level or lower using a surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.
