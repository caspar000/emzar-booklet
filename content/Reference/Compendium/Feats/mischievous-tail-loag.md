# Mischievous Tail  *Feat 13*  
[ganzi](ganzi-loag.md "Ganzi Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Skillful Tail](skillful-tail-ganzi-loag.md)

Your tail can bedevil your foes. You can [Disarm](Reference/Rules/Actions/disarm.md) and [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md) creatures with your tail, even if you don't have a free hand. All restrictions of [Skillful Tail](skillful-tail-ganzi-loag.md) otherwise continue to apply. If you have [Smashing Tail](smashing-tail-loag.md), your tail unarmed attack gains the [disarm](Reference/Rules/Traits/disarm.md "Disarm Weapon Trait") and [trip](Reference/Rules/Traits/trip.md "Trip Weapon Trait") traits.
