# Cobra Stance  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[monk](Reference/Rules/Traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a tight stance, coiled up like a lashing cobra with your hands poised as venomous fangs. While in this stance, the only [Strikes](strike.md) you can make are cobra fang unarmed attacks.

These deal `1d4` poison damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait"), [deadly <d10>](rules/traits/deadly-d10.md "Deadly Weapon Trait"), [finesse](finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait"), [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), [poison](Reference/Rules/Traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait"), and [unarmed](unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits.

While in Cobra Stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves and your Fortitude DC, and you gain poison resistance equal to half your level.

## Cobra Stance leads to...
