# Inspirit Hazard  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 13*  
[catfolk](catfolk-b1.md "Catfolk Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You Disable a hazard.
- **Requirements**: The hazard isn't [broken](conditions.md#Broken).
- **Activity** Reaction

You awaken a spirit of creation within the hazard. You learn the hazard's effects. Once in the next 10 minutes, when you observe a creature take an action that would trigger one of the hazard's reactions or free actions if you hadn't Disabled it, you can use a reaction to rearm the hazard, causing the [observed](conditions.md#Observed) creature to trigger it immediately.
