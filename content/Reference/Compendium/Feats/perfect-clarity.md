# Perfect Clarity  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 18*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [fortune](fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [rage](Reference/Rules/Traits/rage.md "Rage Combat Trait")  

- **Trigger** You fail or critically fail an attack roll or Will save.
- **Activity** Reaction

You burn out all of your rage to ensure that your attack lands and your mind remains free. Reroll the triggering attack roll or Will save with a +2 circumstance bonus, use the better result, and resolve the effect. You then immediately stop raging.
