# Effortless Captivation  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Captivator Dedication](captivator-dedication-lotgb.md)
- **Trigger** Your turn begins.
- **Activity** Free Action

You maintain your innate enchantments and illusions with hardly a thought. You immediately gain the effects of the [Sustain a Spell](sustain-a-spell.md) action, which you can use only to extend the duration of an enchantment or illusion spell.
