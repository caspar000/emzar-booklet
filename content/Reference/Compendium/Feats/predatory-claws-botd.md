# Predatory Claws  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vampire Dedication](vampire-dedication-botd.md)

Your nails grow into sharp claws, perfect for seizing and tearing your prey. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals `1d4` slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the [agile](agile.md "Agile Weapon Trait"), [finesse](finesse.md "Finesse Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits.

If you hit the same enemy with two consecutive claw [Strikes](strike.md) in the same round, you can attempt to [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md) that same target as a free action, provided you take that action immediately after the second [Strike](strike.md).
