# Fey Caller  *Feat 8*  
[druid](Reference/Rules/Traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  


You have learned some of the tricks the fey use to bend primal magic toward illusions and trickery. Add [illusory disguise](illusory-disguise.md), [illusory object](illusory-object.md), [illusory scene](illusory-scene.md), and [veil](veil.md) to your spell list as primal spells.
