- **Requirements**: You're wielding a firearm.
- **Activity** Single Action

You've practiced a technique for rapidly reloading your firearm, but attempting to use this technique is a dangerous gamble with your firearm's functionality. [Interact](interact.md) to reload a firearm, then make a [Strike](strike.md) with that firearm. If the [Strike](strike.md) fails, the firearm misfires.
