# Raging Thrower  *Feat 1*  
[barbarian](Reference/Rules/Traits/barbarian.md "Barbarian Class Trait")  


Thrown weapons become especially deadly in your fury. You apply the additional damage from [Rage](Reference/Rules/Actions/rage.md) to your thrown weapon attacks. If you have the [Brutal Critical](brutal-critical.md) feat or the devastator class feature, apply their benefits to thrown weapon attacks.
