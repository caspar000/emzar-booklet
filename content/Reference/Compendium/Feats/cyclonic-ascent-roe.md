# Cyclonic Ascent  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[air](air.md "Air Energy & Element Trait")  [impulse](impulse-roe.md "Impulse Action & Ability Trait")  [kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Whorls of wind surround your lower body, forming a cyclone that lifts you into the air. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed or 30 feet, whichever is greater, for 10 minutes. Unlike with a normal fly Speed, you can move upward without treating it as difficult terrain. In addition, you can remain in the air at the end of your turn if you used an air impulse during that turn, even if you didn't use a [Fly](Reference/Rules/Actions/fly.md) action that turn.
