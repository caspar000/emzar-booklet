[kineticist](kineticist-roe.md "Kineticist Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: reflow elements
- **Activity** Single Action

You can realign your kinetic gate with a thought. Replace one of your impulse feats using the same process as reflow elements. You can replace only one, even if you have double reflow.
