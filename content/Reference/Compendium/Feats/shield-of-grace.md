# Shield Of Grace  *Feat 16*  
[champion](Reference/Rules/Traits/champion.md "Champion Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Shield Warden](shield-warden-champion.md)

You protect an ally with both your shield and your body. Whenever you use the [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md) reaction to prevent damage to an ally, you can evenly split the remaining damage after the [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md) between the ally and yourself.
