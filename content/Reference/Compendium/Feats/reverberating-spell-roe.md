# Reverberating Spell  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [metal](metal-roe.md "Metal Energy & Element Trait")  [spellshape](spellshape-roe.md "Spellshape General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](elementalist-dedication-roe.md), metal is in your elemental philosophy
- **Activity** Single Action

Your spell disorients your targets with a metallic clangor. If the next action you use this turn is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that deals damage in an area (such as a burst, line, or cone), the spell deals an additional `1d8` sonic damage and all creatures who fail their save against the spell are [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 round. Targets who critically fail their saves against this spell are instead [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute. The spell gains the [sonic](sonic.md "Sonic Energy & Element Trait") trait.
