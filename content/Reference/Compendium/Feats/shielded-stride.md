# Shielded Stride  *Feat 4*  
[fighter](Reference/Rules/Traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  


When your shield is up, your enemies' blows can't touch you. When you have your [shield raised](raise-a-shield.md), you can [Stride](stride.md) to move half your Speed without triggering reactions that are triggered by your movement (such as [Attacks of Opportunity](Reference/Rules/Abilities/attack-of-opportunity.md)). You can use Shielded Stride while Flying or Swimming instead of [Striding](stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
