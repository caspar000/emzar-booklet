# Tidal Shield  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 17*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [undine](undine-b2.md "Undine Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [water](water.md "Water Energy & Element Trait")  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You conjure the force of the tides to gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn. Any allies adjacent to you during the duration gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC as long as they remain adjacent to you. You can Sustain the effect to a maximum duration of 5 rounds. When a creature receiving a circumstance bonus to AC from Tidal Shield would take damage from an attack, as a reaction, you can reduce the damage to that creature by 40; after you do so, Tidal Shield ends.
