# Defensive Coordination  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait")  [bard](Reference/Rules/Traits/bard.md "Bard Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: warrior muse, [Inspire Defense](Reference/Compendium/Feats/inspire-defense.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

Like the storied heroes who persist in the face of overwhelming odds, you and your allies will hold the line.

If your next action is to cast the [inspire defense](Reference/Compendium/Spells/inspire-defense.md) composition cantrip, you can [Raise a Shield](raise-a-shield.md), and one ally who gains a status bonus from the spell can immediately use a reaction to [Raise a Shield](raise-a-shield.md).
