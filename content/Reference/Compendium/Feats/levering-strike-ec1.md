# Levering Strike  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [press](press.md "Press Combat Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Staff Acrobat Dedication](staff-acrobat-dedication-ec1.md)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding your staff.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Make a [Strike](strike.md) with your staff. As long as you don't critically fail, the target becomes [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) and takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its DC against [Shove](Reference/Rules/Actions/shove.md), [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md), and [Tumble Through](tumble-through.md) attempts until the start of your next turn.
