# Stonegate  *Feat 17*  
[dwarf](dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Stonewalker](stonewalker.md)

Earthen barriers no longer impede your progress. You gain [passwall](passwall.md) as a 7th-level divine innate spell that you can cast once per day. Unlike the spell, however, this ability can be used only to open passages through barriers of earth or stone.
