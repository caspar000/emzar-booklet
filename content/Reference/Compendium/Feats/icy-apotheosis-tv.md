# Icy Apotheosis  *Feat 20*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  


You are as much a creature of cold as whatever ancestry you were born to. You are immune to cold damage and gain the [cold](cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait") trait. You automatically succeed on saving throws against effects that have the [cold](cold.md "Cold Energy & Element Trait") trait.
