# Detective's Readiness  *Feat 4*  
[investigator](Reference/Rules/Traits/investigator-apg.md "Investigator Class Trait")  


When you're on a case, you stay watchful and resolute to avoid tricks your suspect might pull. You gain your circumstance bonus from [Pursue a Lead](pursue-a-lead-apg.md) on saving throws (and their DCs, as normal) against the subject of a lead, and you can use [Clue In](clue-in-apg.md) to assist an ally's saving throw against that subject.
