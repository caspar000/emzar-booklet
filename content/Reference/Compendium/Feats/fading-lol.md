# Fading  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [teleportation](teleportation.md "Teleportation Effect Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Crimson Shroud](crimson-shroud-lowg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per Crimson Shroud
- **Trigger** You are targeted with a [Strike](strike.md) by someone you can detect while your Crimson
- **Activity** Reaction

You fade partially from reality. The attacker must attempt a DC 11 flat check; on a failure, the attack passes harmlessly through the image of your body that remains behind. An instant later you return to reality, and your Crimson Shroud ends.
