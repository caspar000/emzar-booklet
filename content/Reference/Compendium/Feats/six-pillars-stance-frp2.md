[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sixth Pillar Dedication](sixth-pillar-dedication-frp2.md)
- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You stand firm, steeling your mind and body, allowing you to use your magic unperturbed. While in this stance, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against reactions triggered by using actions with the [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") or [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") traits. In addition, when you cast a spell that requires one or more actions while in this stance, your unarmed [Strikes](strike.md) gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage.
