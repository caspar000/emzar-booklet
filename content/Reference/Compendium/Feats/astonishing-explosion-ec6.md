- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Trigger** You use [Quick Alchemy](Reference/Rules/Actions/quick-alchemy.md) to craft an alchemical bomb that deals splash damage and is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your bomb incorporates an explosive spark of wonder that leaves witnesses dumbfounded. Any target hit by your [Strike](strike.md) with the bomb is [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated) by you for 1 round. On a critical success, the target is also [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned).
