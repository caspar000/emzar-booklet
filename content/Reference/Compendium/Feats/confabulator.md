# Confabulator  *Feat 2*  
[general](general.md "General Feat Trait")  [skill](skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Deception](skills.md#Deception)

Even when caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie. Reduce the circumstance bonus a target gains for your previous attempts to [Create a Diversion](create-a-diversion.md) or [Lie](lie.md) to it from +4 to +2. If you're a master in [Deception](skills.md#Deception), reduce the bonus to +1, and if you're legendary, your targets don't get these bonuses at all.
