# Cunning Trickster Mask  *Feat 20*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [druid](Reference/Rules/Traits/druid.md "Druid Class Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [wizard](Reference/Rules/Traits/wizard.md "Wizard Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication

Your mask carries the legacy of Verdant Spider, the Speaker of Needs, allowing you to deceive and outwit your foes. You can attempt to [Feint](feint.md) a target from up to 30 feet away, and if you succeed or critically succeed in your [Feint](feint.md) attempt, the target of your [Feint](feint.md) takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to saving throws against your spells until the start of your next turn. If you don't have the Conceal Spell feat, you gain it as a bonus feat, allowing you to disguise your spellcasting from others' eyes. If you already have the Conceal Spell feat, you can use Conceal Spell once per round as a free action instead of as a single action.
