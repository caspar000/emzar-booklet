# Group Aid  *Feat 9*  
[human](human.md "Human Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


Your upbringing emphasized teamwork and helping your allies comes naturally to you. After you [Aid](aid.md) an ally at a skill check that doesn't have the [attack](attack.md "Attack Combat Trait") trait, you can also [Aid](aid.md) any other ally who attempts the same skill check for the same purpose that round.

You do so as a free action rather than a reaction.

The preparation you did to help must still apply to the other allies, and you can [Aid](aid.md) each ally only once. For example, if you helped lift up an ally to [Aid](aid.md) them on an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to scale a wall, you could keep the same posture to give a boost to other allies attempting to scale the wall in the same round.
