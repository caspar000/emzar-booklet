# Terrible Transformation  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: Ursine Avenger Form

You let out a mighty roar as part of your transformation. When you use Ursine Avenger Form, you can make an [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Demoralize](demoralize.md) against each enemy within 30 feet that can see you, and you don't take a penalty to your [Demoralize](demoralize.md) check if the creature doesn't understand your language.
