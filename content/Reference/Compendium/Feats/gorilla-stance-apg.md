# Gorilla Stance  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](Reference/Rules/Traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

You lower yourself to the ground and take an imposing, knuckle-walking stance. While in this stance, the only [Strikes](strike.md) you can make are gorilla slam unarmed attacks.

These deal `1d8` bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [backswing](backswing.md "Backswing Weapon Trait"), [forceful](forceful.md "Forceful Weapon Trait"), [grapple](Reference/Rules/Traits/grapple.md "Grapple Weapon Trait"), [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits. While you are in Gorilla Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Climb](climb.md), and if you roll a success on an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [Climb](climb.md), you get a critical success instead.
