# Echoing Channel  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 18*  
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [metamagic](metamagic.md "Metamagic General Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

When you pull forth positive or negative energy, you also create a smaller pocket of that energy. If the next action you use is to cast a 2-action [harm](harm.md) or [heal](heal.md) to heal or damage a single creature, choose one additional creature adjacent to either you or the target. Target that creature with a 1-action version of the same spell. This spell is the same level as the 2-action harm or heal you cast and doesn't cost another spell slot.
