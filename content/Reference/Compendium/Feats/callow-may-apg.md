# Callow May  *Feat 1*  
[changeling](changeling-b1.md "Changeling Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [lineage](lineage-apg.md "Lineage  Trait")  


You are among the most common of changelings—those born to green hags—and a vibrant green eye signifies that parentage.

Your mother's manipulative nature and versatile voice gives you an edge when deceiving others. You gain the [Charming Liar](charming-liar.md) skill feat. If you roll [Deception](skills.md#Deception) for initiative, foes in that combat encounter that haven't acted yet are [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against you.
