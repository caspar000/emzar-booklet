[archetype](archetype.md "Archetype Feat Trait")  [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait")  [skill](skill.md "Skill Feat Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md), trained in [Survival](skills.md#Survival)
- **Activity** Two-Action
