# Quick Reversal  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[fighter](Reference/Rules/Traits/fighter.md "Fighter Class Trait")  [flourish](flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  [press](press.md "Press Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You are flanked by at least two enemies.
- **Activity** Single Action

You turn your foes' flanking against them with a quick reverse. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against one of the flanking enemies and make a second [Strike](strike.md) with the same weapon or unarmed attack against a different enemy that is flanking you. This second [Strike](strike.md) has the same multiple attack penalty of the initial attack and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.
