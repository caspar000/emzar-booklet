# Stoked Flame Stance  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [fire](fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [monk](Reference/Rules/Traits/monk.md "Monk Class Trait")  [stance](stance.md "Stance Combat Trait")  

- **Requirements**: You're unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a stance of fast, fiery movements. You can make flashing spark attacks that deal `1d8` slashing damage. They are in the brawling group and have the [forceful](forceful.md "Forceful Weapon Trait"), [nonlethal](nonlethal.md "Nonlethal Weapon Trait"), [sweep](sweep.md "Sweep Weapon Trait"), and [unarmed](unarmed.md "Unarmed Weapon Trait") traits. If you have access to the flashing sparks' critical specialization effect, you can take an alternate effect instead: if your critical [Strike](strike.md) dealt damage, the target takes `1d6` [persistent fire damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

While in Stoked Flame Stance, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed. If you have incredible movement, increase the benefit from incredible movement to a +15-foot status bonus plus 5 feet for every 4 levels beyond 3rd.

**Special.** This feat gains your choice of either the [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait") or [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait") trait, matching your ki spell tradition if possible.

## Stoked Flame Stance leads to...

[Blazing Streak](blazing-streak-som.md), [Inner Fire](inner-fire-som.md)
