# Syu Tak-nwa's Hexed Locks  *Feat 8*  
[uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  [witch](Reference/Rules/Traits/witch-apg.md "Witch Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: [Living Hair](living-hair-apg.md)

Your hair unarmed attack gains the [reach](reach.md "Reach Weapon Trait") trait. You can deliver hexes through your hair.

When you successfully cast a hex focus spell that requires 2 or more actions to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a hair [Strike](strike.md) against the foe before applying [any](any-b1.md "Any Alignment Trait") effects of the hex. If this [Strike](strike.md) misses, the hex has no effect.
