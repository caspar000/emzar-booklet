# Spring From The Shadows  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[flourish](flourish.md "Flourish Combat Trait")  [rogue](Reference/Rules/Traits/rogue.md "Rogue Class Trait")  

- **Activity** Single Action

Leaping out from hiding, you assail your target when they least expect it. You [Stride](stride.md) up to your Speed, but you must end your movement next to an enemy you're [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from or [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) by. You then [Strike](strike.md) that enemy; you remain [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from or [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) by that creature until after you [Strike](strike.md). You can use Spring from the Shadows while [Burrowing](burrow.md), [Climbing](climb.md), [Flying](Reference/Rules/Actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](swim.md) instead of [Striding](stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
