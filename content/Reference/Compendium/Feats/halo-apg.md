# Halo  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](aasimar-apg.md "Aasimar Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  


You are surrounded by a halo of light and goodness at all times. Your halo sheds light with the effects of a divine [light](Reference/Compendium/Spells/light.md) cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. You can suppress or reestablish the halo with a single action, which has the [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait.

## Halo leads to...
