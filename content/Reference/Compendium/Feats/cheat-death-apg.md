# Cheat Death  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 12*  
[swashbuckler](Reference/Rules/Traits/swashbuckler-apg.md "Swashbuckler Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** You take damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points.
- **Activity** Reaction

Somehow you always escape the reaper by a hair's breadth.

You avoid being knocked out or killed and remain at 1 Hit Point, but you become [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed) (or increase your [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed) value by 1 if you were already [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed)). You can't reduce or ignore the [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed) condition from Cheating Death. The [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed) condition from Cheating Death lasts for 10 minutes, though this doesn't affect the duration of any other [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed) condition you have.
