# Counterspell (Witch)  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [witch](Reference/Rules/Traits/witch-apg.md "Witch Class Trait")  

- **Trigger** A creature [Casts a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) that you have prepared.
- **Activity** Reaction

When a foe [Casts a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own magic to disrupt it. You expend a prepared spell to counter the triggering creature's casting of that same spell. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell.

**Special.** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast ([arcane](arcane.md "Arcane Tradition Trait"), [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait"), [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait"), or [occult](occult.md "Occult Tradition Trait")).
