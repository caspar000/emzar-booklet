# Fast Channel  *Feat 14*  
[cleric](Reference/Rules/Traits/cleric.md "Cleric Class Trait")  

- **Prerequisites**: harmful font or healing font

Divine power is always at your fingertips, swiftly responding to your call. When you cast [harm](harm.md) or [heal](heal.md) by spending 2 actions, you can get the effects of the 3-action version instead of the 2-action version. You can do this with harm if you have harmful font or heal if you have healing font (or both if you have [Versatile Font](versatile-font.md)).
