# Sinful Tongue
*Curse 7*  
[curse](curse.md "Curse Effect Trait")  [enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

This curse is typically used as punishment by good clergy. The curse causes you to envision your wrongdoings whenever you attempt to lie or deceive, a burden that can be cured only by confessing your past transgressions.

title: Saving Throw: DC 23 Will

[misfortune](rules/traits/misfortune.md "Misfortune Effect Trait")  
**Effect** The weight of guilt distracts you, making it hard for you to deceive people. Whenever you attempt a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check, roll the check twice and take the worse result.

## Tempting Curse

You begin to confess your sins, beginning from youthful indiscretions and ending with the present day. While you confess, all creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or gain the [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated) condition as they listen. You must spend at least 2 actions per round, which have the [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait, listing your wrongdoings. This is an [auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait"), [enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait"), [emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait"), and [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect. Once you stop confessing your sins, or after 10 minutes if you haven't finished confessing your sins, the effect ends, and you can't confess again until your next daily preparations. Your conscience is clearer having confessed, and you take only a â€“2 status penalty to [Deception](skills.md#Deception) checks.
