# Soul Draining Cage *Hazard 6*  
[magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [negative](negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  [trap](trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 25 expert or [detect magic](Reference/Compendium/Spells/detect-magic.md)  

Necromantic runes inscribed on the cage bars and lock drain the vitality of living creatures who interact with the cage.

- **Disable** [Thievery](skills.md#Thievery) DC 25 (expert) to drain the runes' power harmlessly or dispel magic (3rd level; counteract DC 22) to counteract the rune

title: **Soul Drain** [R](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") ([arcane](rules/traits/arcane.md), [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md), [negative](rules/traits/negative.md))

- **Trigger**: A creature touches the cage bars, door, or lock directly or with a tool

**Effect** The trap deals `4d8+18` negative damage to the triggering creature, creatures inside the cage, and all creatures adjacent to the cage (DC 27 basic Fortitude save). On a failed save, a creature is also [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained).
