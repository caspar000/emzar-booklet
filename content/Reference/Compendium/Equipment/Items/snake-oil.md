# Snake Oil *Item 1*  
[alchemical](alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  

- **Price** 2 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 2 hands
- **Activate** [Interact](interact.md)

You can apply snake oil onto a wound or other outward symptom of an affliction or condition (such as sores from a disease or discoloration from a poison). For the next hour, the symptom disappears and the [wounded](conditions.md#Wounded) or afflicted creature doesn't feel as if it still has the wound or affliction, though all effects remain. A creature can uncover the ruse by succeeding at a DC 17 [Perception](skills.md#Perception) check, but only if it uses a [Seek](seek.md) action to specifically examine the snake oil's effects.
