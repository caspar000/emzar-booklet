- **Price** 20 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply ectoplasmic residue from a destroyed ghost.
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](interact.md)

A daub of ectoplasm twitches within this glass container, faintly glowing with ghostly light. When opened it forms the echo of a departed spirit, which looks like a Medium ghost. You can throw the ampoule up to 30 feet when you Activate it.

The ghost utters a final lament, forcing each living creature in a 15-foot emanation except you to attempt a DC 18 Will save.

On a failure, a creature becomes [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) (or [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical failure).
