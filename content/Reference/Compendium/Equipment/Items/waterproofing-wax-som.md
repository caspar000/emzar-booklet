# Waterproofing Wax *Item 3*  
[catalyst](catalyst-som.md "Catalyst Item Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

Many books and spellbooks are treated in this wax formula to protect them from the elements, but waterproofing wax's liquid-repellent properties can be further applied to split up a [grease](grease.md) spell into useful smaller sections. When the spell is cast in an area while using this catalyst, the conjured grease fills three 5-foot squares within 30 feet instead of its normal area; these squares don't need to be contiguous.
