# Savior Spike *Item 2*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [force](force.md "Force Energy & Element Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 7 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** command; **Trigger** You attempt to [Grab an Edge](grab-an-edge.md) but haven't rolled; **Requirements** You're an expert in Reflex.

This pyramid-shaped spike is attached to an armor's chest piece. When you activate the spike, it shoots a strand of force to help you gain purchase. If you roll a success on the triggering attempt, you get a critical success instead (if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead).
