# Fearcracker *Item 5*  
[catalyst](catalyst-som.md "Catalyst Item Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 25 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md)

A fearcracker contains fragments of [broken](conditions.md#Broken) mirrors and reagents that pop and smoke when consumed. When thrown down in your space as part of a [mirror image](mirror-image.md) spell, your and your images' appearance twists nightmarishly. When an image is destroyed, it "dies" in a disturbing fashion, rendering the attacker [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened). This aspect of the spell has the emotion, [fear](Reference/Rules/Traits/fear.md "Fear Effect Trait"), and [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") traits.
