# Staff Of Impossible Visions *Item 6+*  
[illusion](illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [staff](Reference/Rules/Traits/staff.md "Staff Item Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This bizarre staff is made from oak, capped with a cluster of eye-shaped gemstones that seem to move and undulate at the corner of your vision. While wielding the staff, you can peer through the eyes, using your normal visual senses (including any benefits of spells affecting your vision, like see invisibility). You can maneuver the staff to see things around corners, at higher elevations, or in places where the staff can fit but your head can't. This doesn't provide sufficient line of effect to target creatures around corners.

The eyes are as vulnerable as your eyes and can be affected by anything that alters your vision, such as a blinding flash of light.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate**  [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md)


You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
