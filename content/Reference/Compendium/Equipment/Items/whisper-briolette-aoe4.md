- **Price** 55 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor or to an outfit if a character has no
- **Activate** envision; **Requirements** You are an expert in [Stealth](skills.md#Stealth)

This teardrop-shaped gemstone has triangular facets and looks suitable for fancy attire, although close inspection shows that it's hollow. When it's activated, you can instantly impart up to 1 minute of speech (roughly 150 words) telepathically to any creatures you choose within 100 feet. You can impart this instantaneous telepathic message to creatures that you perceive and creatures [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to you, but you can't do so to [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) creatures.

Once used, the whisper briolette becomes unusable and subtly vanishes within the next few minutes, rather than crumbling to dust.
