Composing a stage fright missive usually involves creating a scathing review, insulting letter, or embarrassing image that ridicules the recipient. The activating creature must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be overcome with embarrassment for 1 hour, taking a –1 status penalty to [Deception](skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy), [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation), and [Performance](skills.md#Performance) checks. During this time, if the creature attempts to speak or perform in front of an audience, they become [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened). When they recover from this [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened) condition, the missive's effects end. You choose when composing the missive whether it remains as a non‑magical document or burns to ash after imparting its magic.
