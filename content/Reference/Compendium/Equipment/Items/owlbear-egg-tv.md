Not only are owlbear eggs delicious when boiled, but when infused with a mix of alchemical reagents, they also make you emit a long screech much like an owlbear's. All creatures in a 30-foot emanation must attempt a DC 23 Will save. Regardless of the result, creatures in the area are temporarily immune to this screech for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Failure** The creature is [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) and [fleeing](conditions.md#Fleeing) for 1 round.
