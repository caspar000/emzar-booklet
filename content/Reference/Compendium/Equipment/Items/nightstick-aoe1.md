This collapsible baton consists of several nested, telescoping metal shafts that can be extended as a free action by flicking the wrist. Once extended to its full length (usually around 2 feet), the baton locks into shape until the wielder uses an [Interact](interact.md) action to collapse itâ€”a collapsed nightstick is 8 inches long, making it easily [concealed](conceal-an-object.md).

Lighter and more maneuverable than an ordinary [club](club.md) or truncheon, nightsticks are designed to subdue foes without causing permanent injury. A nightstick is an uncommon simple melee weapon.
