When you [Strike](strike.md) a creature with a sack of rotten fruit, the sack is consumed while the creature takes `1d4` bludgeoning damage and must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened). The range increment of a thrown sack of rotten fruit is 20 feet.
