This tiny, silver facsimile of a weapon tripod is usually attached to the underside of the affixed weapon's barrel.

When activated, it creates an [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) construct of magical force that attaches to the weapon and automatically stabilizes it in any location, even in midair. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until you [Dismiss](dismiss.md) it. The effect also ends immediately if you let go of the affixed weapon. The affixed weapon cannot be moved while this effect is active.
