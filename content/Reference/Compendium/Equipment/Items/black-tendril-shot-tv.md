# Black Tendril Shot *Item 7+*  
[conjuration](conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Ammunition** any
- **Activate** command

A glistening, tarâ€‘like substance that's displeasing to the touch coats a black tendril shot. When the activated ammunition hits a target, it exudes tendrils that encase the target, which must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. The ammunition's effects last until the target Escapes. DCs for the saving throw and [Escape](escape.md) vary by type.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to [Escape](escape.md) the ammunition's effect.
> - **Success** The target is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed).
> - **Failure** The target is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) and [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed), [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded), and [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened).
