# Lion Badge *Item 4*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 15 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You gain the [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition as a result of a Will save; **Requirements** You're an expert in Will saves.

This plain wooden badge has the face of a roaring lion etched onto its surface. When you activate this talisman, reduce the value of your [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition by 1 (to a minimum of 0). When this talisman is used, the image of the lion fades and the item becomes a plain, non-magical wooden badge.
