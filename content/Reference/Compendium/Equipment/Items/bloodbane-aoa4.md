- **Usage** etched onto a clan dagger

A _bloodbane_ clan dagger is especially vicious against the ancestral enemies of the clan. When you damage an appropriate type of creature with the weapon, that creature takes 1 [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The type of creature depends on the clan that made the dagger, but is typically drow, duergar, giant, or orc.

In addition, whenever you inflict [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) with a _bloodbane_ weapon (whether from its innate ability or in some other way), the weapon leaves ragged wounds. The bleeding creature must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or become [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened). The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
