When a creature enters the snare's square, several strands of strong wires ending in jagged hooks latch onto it before hauling it to the ground. The snare deals `2d6` piercing damage, and the targeted creature must attempt a DC 28 Reflex save.

> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone), and is [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) for 1 round ([Escape](escape.md) DC 28).
