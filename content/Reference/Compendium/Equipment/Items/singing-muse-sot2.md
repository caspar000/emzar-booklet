- **Price** 250 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You attempt a [Performance](skills.md#Performance) check.

This small figurine is carved from a single piece of silvery, spiky stone and resembles a beautiful dryad pouring water into a small pool. When you activate the muse, you are momentarily enlightened with inspiration that bolsters your performance. If you roll a success on your triggering check, you get a critical success instead.
