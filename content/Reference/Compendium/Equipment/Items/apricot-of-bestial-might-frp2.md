This yellow fruit's soft flesh is covered by waxy, fibrous leaves reminiscent of a pineapple. When you eat an apricot of bestial might, you transform into a boar-faced battle form with scaly skin. You can use feats with this item as if it were a bestial mutagen, improving your tusk unarmed attack as if it were a claw or jaws attack.

Benefit You gain 8 resistance to all physical damage and gain a tusk unarmed attack with the [deadly <d12>](rules/traits/deadly-d12.md "Deadly Weapon Trait") trait that deals `1d10` piercing damage.

Drawback You become [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy). If you perform an action with the [auditory](auditory.md "Auditory Effect Trait") or [linguistic](linguistic.md "Linguistic Effect Trait") traits, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost.
