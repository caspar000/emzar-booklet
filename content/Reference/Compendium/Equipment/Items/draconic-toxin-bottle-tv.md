# Draconic Toxin Bottle *Item 7*

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

This glass bottle appears to be a dragon's breath potion of a specific dragon type (usually red) but has been polluted, making it toxic to use.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You drink from the bottle and must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or become [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) ([sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical failure) and immediately vomit the potion directly onto yourself, taking damage as though you had failed a save against a standard dragon's breath potion (Core Rulebook 562). If you succeed at your Fortitude save, you become [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) but otherwise are able to unleash a breath weapon as normal for a dragon's breath potion of the appropriate type.
