# Stumbling Fulu *Item 3*  
[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fulu](fulu-som.md "Fulu Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor

The kitsune who first created a stumbling fulu advised the user to tuck the fulu under the target's belt for maximum effect.

When the creature to which the fulu is affixed completes a [Stride](stride.md) action, the creature must attempt a DC 17 Reflex save. On a failure, some element of the armor the fulu is affixed to comes undone, making the wearer [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy). On a critical failure, the target falls [prone](conditions.md#Prone) and is [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy). The [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) condition remains until the target takes a total of 1 [Interact](interact.md) action, plus 1 additional [Interact](interact.md) action per value of the [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) condition above 1, to properly reclothe itself. Once the fulu activates, it burns up, its magic lasting only as long as the conditions it has imposed.
