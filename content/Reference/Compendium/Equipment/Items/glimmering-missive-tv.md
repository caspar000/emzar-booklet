A glimmering missive sparkles as you compose it. When activated, it explodes, disintegrating into a shower of multicolored motes in a 10‑foot burst from a corner of the missive's space. Creatures in the area are covered in sparkling dust that remains luminous for 1 hour. Visible creatures can't be [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) while covered by the luminous dust; any [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) creatures are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) while covered in the luminous dust, rather than being [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected).
