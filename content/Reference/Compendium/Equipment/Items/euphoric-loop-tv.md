# Euphoric Loop *Item 5+*  
[catalyst](catalyst-som.md "Catalyst Item Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 5 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md)

This catalyst is made from twisted sapling bark harvested under a full moon. When used to cast a [charm](charm.md) spell, the enchantment creates a blissful experience for one target of your choice.

> - **Critical Failure** The target is [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned) or, if the spell ended because of a [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) action, [confused](conditions.md#Confused) for 2 rounds.
