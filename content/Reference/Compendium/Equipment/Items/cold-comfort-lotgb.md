- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand

The contraption called cold comfort is a watertight pouch filled with a handful of small, heavy, silvery pellets. When emptied into an adjacent body of water, the pellets freeze the water's surface almost instantly, creating an ice block in a 10-foot square to a depth of 1 foot. Any creatures inside this space must attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature takes `2d6` cold damage and is [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 minute or until it [Escapes](escape.md) (DC 20) or the ice is [broken](conditions.md#Broken). The entire ice block has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits, cold damage, and precision damage. The ice is strong enough to support one [Large](large-b1.md "Large Size Trait") creature or up to four [Medium](medium-b1.md "Medium Size Trait") or [Small](small-b1.md "Small Size Trait") creatures. Traversing the slippery ice requires a successful DC 20 [Acrobatics](skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Balance](balance.md).
