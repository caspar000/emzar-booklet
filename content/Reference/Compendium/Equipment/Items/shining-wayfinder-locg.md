A shining wayfinder is a polished silver compass blessed by the power of benevolent deities. It has the usual functions of a wayfinder, except instead of an activation to cast [light](Reference/Compendium/Spells/light.md), the shining wayfinder has the following two activations.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)


You hold the wayfinder and ask for guidance. The wayfinder casts guidance on you.
```

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You call upon the wayfinder's divine blessings for yourself and your allies. The wayfinder casts bless, with an emanation centered on itself. Once per turn, you can use a single action, which has the [concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet.
