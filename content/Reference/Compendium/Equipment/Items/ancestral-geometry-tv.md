# Ancestral Geometry *Item 2*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [invested](invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [tattoo](tattoo-lowg.md "Tattoo Item Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 30 gp
- **Bulk** —; **Usage** tattooed on the body

Geometric precision and perfect angles signify that an artist with exemplary knowledge of dwarven tattooing traditions created this body art. Your family's ancestral stories, recited throughout the tattooing process, bind your blood even tighter to theirs. During your daily preparations, you manifest a visitation by an ancestor—possibly via a dream, a vision, or a magical trinket left by your bedroll. Roll `2d20` and record the highest result. Then roll `1d6` and note a type of saving throw:

1–2 Fortitude, 3–4 Reflex, and 5–6 Will.

In addition, until the next visitation, you gain a +1 item bonus to one [Lore](skills.md#Lore) skill related to the ancestor, as determined by the GM.

Usually, the ancestor provides a kind of knowledge they believe you'll need. For dwarven ancestors, the [Lore](skills.md#Lore) skill is usually [Architecture Lore](skills.md#Lore), [Engineering Lore](skills.md#Lore), [Genealogy Lore](skills.md#Lore), [Labor Lore](skills.md#Lore), [Mining Lore](skills.md#Lore), [Warfare Lore](skills.md#Lore), or [Lore](skills.md#Lore) about a dwarven deity.
