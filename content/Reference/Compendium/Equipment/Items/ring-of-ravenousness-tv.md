# Ring of Ravenousness *Item 7*  
[conjuration](conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [cursed](cursed-gmg.md "Cursed Item Trait")  [invested](invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** worn

Carved of acacia wood, a ring of ravenousness is inlaid with a geometric pattern. The ring appears to be a ring of sustenance. Once you invest it, though, it fuses to you, its effects activating immediately. While wearing the ring, you require twice the normal amount of food and drink for a creature your size to avoid starvation and thirst.
