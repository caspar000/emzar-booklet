# Unholy Water *Item 1*  
[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [divine](divine.md "Divine Tradition Trait")  [evil](evil.md "Evil Alignment Trait")  [necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [splash](splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait")  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Strike](strike.md)

An evil deity's malice lies within this vial of water. You activate a vial of unholy water by throwing it as a [Strike](strike.md). It's a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait to the attack made with it.

Unholy water deals `1d6` evil damage and 1 evil splash damage.

It damages only celestials and creatures that have a weakness to evil damage.
