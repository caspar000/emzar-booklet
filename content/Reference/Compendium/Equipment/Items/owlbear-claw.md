# Owlbear Claw *Item 1*  
[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You critically succeed at an attack roll with the affixed weapon.

This claw set in an iron clasp and chain isn't always the claw of an owlbear. When you activate the claw, the triggering attack gains the weapon's critical specialization effect.
