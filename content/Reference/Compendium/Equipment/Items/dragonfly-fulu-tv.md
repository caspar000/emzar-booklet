[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fulu](fulu-som.md "Fulu Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 60 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You take the [Leap](leap.md) action.

Tradition says the dragonfly fulu should be affixed to the upper back, like the wings of an insect. When you Activate this fulu, you gain a +2 status bonus to [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) checks to [High Jump](high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](long-jump.md) for 1 minute. During this time, you can attempt an [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [High Jump](high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](long-jump.md) as a single action without the [Stride](stride.md) requirement. You can also [High Jump](high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](long-jump.md) from a nonsolid substance, such as air or water, but if you use this power of the fulu, its effects ends after you jump.
