- **Activate** [Interact](interact.md), [Strike](strike.md)

A rod of blackened bone with a bulb at one end comprises a reaper's spellgun, which feels heavier than it looks. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun fires a shadowy ray, then dissolves into gray mist.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target takes `4d6` negative damage and is [drained](conditions.md#Drained) and [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed). If it had fewer than half its maximum Hit Points after taking the negative damage, it's [drained](conditions.md#Drained) instead. If the Hit Point loss from being [drained](conditions.md#Drained) drops the creature to 0 Hit Points, it dies.
> - **Success** As critical success, but for the [drained](conditions.md#Drained) condition, the target is [drained](conditions.md#Drained), or [drained](conditions.md#Drained) if it had fewer than half its maximum HP.
