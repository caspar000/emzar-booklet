# Crowbar *Item 0*  

- **Price** 5 sp
- **Bulk** L
- **Hands** 2

When [Forcing Open](force-open.md) an object that doesn't have an easy grip, a crowbar makes it easier to gain the necessary leverage. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a â€“2 item penalty to the [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [Force Open](force-open.md).

### Variants

#### Base *Item 0*


#### Levered *Item 3*

- **Price**: 20 gp

A levered crowbar grants you a +1 item bonus to [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Force Open](force-open.md) anything that can be pried open.
