### Variants

#### amaranth *Item 15*

- **Price**: 5500 gp

The ally feels impervious, immortal. The next time they would take damage from a hazard, an enemy's attack, or an effect created by an enemy, that damage can't reduce the ally below 1 HP. This benefit ends if unused before the start of your next turn.

#### bellflower *Item 7*

- **Price**: 350 gp

Until the end of that ally's next turn, they gain a +2 status bonus to rolls to recover from the [confused](conditions.md#Confused), [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened), [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed), [paralyzed](conditions.md#Paralyzed), and [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) conditions. When you Activate the bloom, the target can attempt a new save against a condition the bonus applies to, or they can use a reaction to attempt to [Escape](escape.md) being [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed), [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized), or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained), provided such an attempt is allowed.

#### cherry blossom *Item 3*

- **Price**: 50 gp

The ally understands the fleeting nature of life and accepts fate. For 1 minute, any recovery checks the ally attempts have a DC of 10 instead of 10 + the ally's [dying](conditions.md#Dying) value. The cherry blossom's activation can target an [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) or [dying](conditions.md#Dying) ally.

#### lilac *Item 2*

- **Price**: 600 gp

A glow envelops your ally as a sense of enlightened peace ripples out from within. The ally gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves against [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effects for 1 minute. This bonus increases to +3 against [emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") effects.

#### magnolia *Item 6*

- **Price**: 220 gp

Your ally seems more charming, though no one can pinpoint why. They gain a +1 status bonus to [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy) checks for 10 minutes. Once on their next turn, the ally can attempt to draw a creature's attention. To do so, the ally must spend 1 action (which has the emotion, [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait"), and [visual](visual.md "Visual Effect Trait") traits) to select a creature the ally can see and make eye contact in a way the target can see. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated) with your ally until the end of that ally's next turn. If the save succeeds or the effect ends, the target is temporarily immune to being [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated) by any magnolia bewitching bloom for 24 hours.

#### purple iris *Item 11*

- **Price**: 1200 gp

Your ally takes on a regal bearing, exuding the presence of confident royalty. The bloom casts a 5th-level [command](command.md) spell (DC 28) selecting targets within range of the ally. Each target that fails the save must fall [prone](conditions.md#Prone) and pays homage to your ally.

#### red rose *Item 4*

- **Price**: 90 gp

The ally fills with feelings of love. They chooses a creature that the ally has strong positive emotions toward as beloved.

While the ally is within 10 feet of this beloved, the ally gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws. If the ally starts their turn within 10 feet of the beloved, the ally gains 5 temporary Hit Points. These benefits last for 1 minute, and temporary HP remaining from this effect at the end of that time disappear.

This effect has the [emotion](emotion.md "Emotion Effect Trait") and [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") traits.

#### white poppy *Item 4*

- **Price**: 80 gp

A sense of peace overwhelms the ally. The tattoo casts calm emotions or sanctuary (your choice) on the ally. The spell affects only the ally and lasts only until the end of your next turn.

Your ally need not be willing if under the control of another creature. However, the controlling creature can attempt a DC 20 Will save, disrupting your activation on a success.
