# Withering *Item 13*  
[cursed](cursed-gmg.md "Cursed Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [necromancy](necromancy.md "Necromancy School Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Usage** curses a ring, staff, or wand

A _withering_ curse shrivels vulnerable flesh. Whenever you [activate](activate-an-item.md) the item, one of your fingers turns black and falls off. You take a â€“1 status penalty to [Thievery](skills.md#Thievery) checks and Dexterity-based attack rolls with a hand missing two or three fingers; if you lose more than four fingers on one hand, you can't use that hand to hold objects or use [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") actions. These fingers can be replaced by magic but are otherwise gone forever. The GM has the final say on how creatures with unusual appendages or numbers of fingers are affected by this curse.
