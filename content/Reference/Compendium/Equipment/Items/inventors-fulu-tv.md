# Inventor's Fulu *Item 6*  
[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fulu](fulu-som.md "Fulu Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 50 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to an innovation
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You critically fail an action with the [unstable](unstable-g-g.md "Unstable  Trait") trait.

Some inventors in Tian Xia put fried snacks near their innovations, a charm to make devices behave as intended. The practice rubbed off on other inventors, who replaced the food with a drawing on an inventor's fulu. When you Activate the fulu, your critical failure becomes a failure, and you can spend just 1 minute to return your innovation to full functionality.

The fulu then burns up, and its effects end.
