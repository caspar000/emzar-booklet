- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](interact.md)

Your features become striking and your voice becomes musical and commanding, though facts and figures become hazy for you and emotion clouds your ability to reason.

**Benefit** You gain an item bonus to [Deception](skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy), [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation), and [Performance](skills.md#Performance) checks. Your critical failures with any of these skill become failures instead.

**Drawback** You take a â€“2 item penalty to [Arcana](skills.md#Arcana), [Crafting](skills.md#Crafting), [Lore](skills.md#Lore), [Occultism](skills.md#Occultism), and [Society](skills.md#Society) checks. Choose one skill in which you are trained; for the duration, you become untrained in that skill. All your failures on checks to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) become critical failures.
