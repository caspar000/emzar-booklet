[clockwork](clockwork-g-g.md "Clockwork  Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fire](fire.md "Fire Energy & Element Trait")  [mechanical](mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [snare](snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 10 gp

Anyone who opens the box triggers a clockwork mechanism that unleashes a 15-foot cone of fire. The cone issues forth in a random direction determined by the GM but always including the creature who opened the box. Those within the cone must succeed at a DC 17 basic Reflex save or take `4d6` fire damage.
