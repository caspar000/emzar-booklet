# Kin-warding *Item 3*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [dwarf](dwarf.md "Dwarf Ancestry & Heritage Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 52 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a clan dagger

A _kin-warding_ clan dagger can deflect attacks aimed at your allies. When you use the weapon's [parry](parry.md "Parry Weapon Trait") trait, you can point the clan dagger at an adjacent ally instead of defending yourself, creating a shield of runes around them. The runic barrier grants your ally the weapon's circumstance bonus to AC, but you do not gain the bonus yourself.
