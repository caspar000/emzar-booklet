# Fiendish Teleportation *Item 11*  
[conjuration](conjuration.md "Conjuration School Trait")  [contract](contract-lol.md "Contract Item Trait")  [invested](invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  


You tap into the fiendish ability to slip through space. When you [Stride](stride.md), you gain a +3 item bonus to Armor Class against reactions triggered by your movement. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can call on a provision in your Thrune contract as a single action, causing you to become [paralyzed](conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 hour or until Abrogail releases you, whichever comes first.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command

- **Frequency**: once per day

**Effect** You recite a subclause of your contract regarding change in venue. You cast [dimension door](compendium/spells/dimension-door.md). The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with the scent of brimstone, dealing `2d6` evil damage to creatures adjacent to both spaces.
