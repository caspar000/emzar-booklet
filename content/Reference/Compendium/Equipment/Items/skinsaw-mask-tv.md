- **Price** 50 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn mask

A patchwork of humanoid flesh makes up a skinsaw mask, which is stitched together with black silk or wire. It is distinctive for its bulbous orange eye—crafted from a magical glass bauble—and wide row of teeth. When worn, the mask amplifies your ability to sense fear in other creatures. You know the value of the [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition of any [observed](conditions.md#Observed) creature, and you gain a +1 item bonus to [Perception](skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](seek.md) [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) creatures. Whenever you deal precision damage to a [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) creature, you deal 1 additional precision damage. If you aren't evil, you are [drained](conditions.md#Drained) while wearing a skinsaw mask.
