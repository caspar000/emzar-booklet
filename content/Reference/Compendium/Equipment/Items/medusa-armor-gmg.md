# Medusa Armor *Item 14*  
[cursed](cursed-gmg.md "Cursed Item Trait")  [invested](invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Bulk** 3; **Usage** worn armor

This +2 adamantine scale mail appears to have a fortification rune but grants none of its effects. Whenever you are critically hit, after taking damage, you become [petrified](conditions.md#Petrified) for 1 round.

Once the curse has activated for the first time, the armor fuses to you.
