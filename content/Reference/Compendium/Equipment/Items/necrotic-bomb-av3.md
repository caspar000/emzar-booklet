# Necrotic Bomb *Item 1+*  
[alchemical](alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [bomb](bomb.md "Bomb Item Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [negative](negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait")  [splash](splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait")

Necrotic bombs combine reagents most people consider disgusting at best and unholy at worst, creating a life-sucking miasma upon contact with air. A necrotic bomb deals the listed negative damage and splash damage, and it sickens the primary target on a critical hit. This damage harms only living creatures.

Many types grant an item bonus to attack rolls.
