# Swift Block Cabochon *Item 7*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 70 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to a shield
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You take damage from a physical attack while you don't have the affixed shield raised.

This clear quartz cabochon attaches to the center of your shield. When you activate the cabochon, you use the [Shield Block](Reference/Compendium/Feats/shield-block.md) reaction even if you hadn't raised the affixed shield (and even if you don't normally have that reaction).
