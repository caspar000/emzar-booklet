# Living Leaf Weave *Item 5*  
[alchemical](alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [healing](healing.md "Healing Effect Trait")  [plant](plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait")  

- **Price** 160 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** worn armor
- **Activate** [Interact](interact.md)

This suit of [leaf weave armor](leaf-weave-tv.md) is specially modified to metabolize the alchemical accelerants in medicinal compounds.

A special receptacle in the armor can hold an elixir of life, which takes 3 [Interact](interact.md) actions to install. A loaded suit of living leaf weave can be activated to grow slithering vines from the armor, granting an item bonus to [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md), to your Fortitude DC to resist [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md), [Disarm](Reference/Rules/Actions/disarm.md), or [Shove](Reference/Rules/Actions/shove.md) attempts, and to your Reflex DCs to resist [Trip](Reference/Rules/Actions/trip.md) attempts. The effects last for 3 rounds, consuming the elixir of life, and once the reaction has begun it can't be deactivated.
