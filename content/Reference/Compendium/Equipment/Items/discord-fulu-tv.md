Incorporating green in its writing, a discord fulu is a popular but unethical tool often deployed on romantic rivals to foil their advances. While the fulu is affixed to it, a creature treats its attitude toward other creatures as one step worse than it is. The creature also takes a –1 status penalty to [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy) checks. The first failure the creature rolls on a [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy) check becomes a critical failure instead, and the fulu turns to ash, ending its effect.
