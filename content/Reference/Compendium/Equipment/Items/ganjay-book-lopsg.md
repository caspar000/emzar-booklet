# Ganjay Book *Item 1*  
[magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Bulk** L or —

This item is a [formula book](formula-book-blank.md), [religious text](religious-text.md), or [spellbook](spellbook-blank.md) that has been creased—possibly by Princess Ganjay herself—to fold up into an impossibly small shape. When folded up, the book can't be read or used, but its Bulk is reduced by 1 (a book that is 1 Bulk becomes light Bulk, and a book that is light Bulk becomes negligible in weight)

You fold or unfold the Ganjay book, manipulating the cunning creases.
