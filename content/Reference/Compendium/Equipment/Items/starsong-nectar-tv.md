# Starsong Nectar *Item 20*  
[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [fortune](fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [potion](potion.md "Potion Item Trait")  [rare](rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 14000 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](interact.md)

A liquid with the appearance of an expressive night sky and a taste that's sheer pleasure, starsong nectar grants you cheerful confidence and incredible luck for 10 minutes after you drink it. However, if you show too much caution at any point during this time (GM's discretion), you must succeed at a DC 6 flat check or the potion's effects end. While the potion lasts, you gain a +3 status bonus to attack rolls, initiative rolls, [Perception](skills.md#Perception) checks, saving throws, and skill checks, and you aren't [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) creatures or when flanked. You are temporarily immune to this potion for 24 hours once its effects end. While the potion lasts, though, if you take a moment to imagine the future, you choose the best courses of action. This aspect of the potion grants you the following activation.

```ad-embed-ability
title: **Activate** [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") envision

- **Frequency**: once per round

**Effect** Until the start of your next turn, roll two d20s for any attack rolls, [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks, saving throws, and skill checks you make and take the higher result.
