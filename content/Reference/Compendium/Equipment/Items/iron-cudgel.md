# Iron Cudgel *Item 14*  
[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 900 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** [Brutal Finish](brutal-finish.md)

You are a master with the affixed weapon.

This miniature iron cudgel is typically affixed to a weapon by an iron chain. When you activate the cudgel, you use Brutal Finish, as the fighter feat (page 151). You must meet the normal requirements, including those of the [press](press.md "Press Combat Trait") trait.

If you have the Brutal Finish feat, add two additional weapon damage dice on a success or a failure.
