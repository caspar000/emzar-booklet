# Mindlock Shot *Item 11*  
[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [enchantment](enchantment.md "Enchantment School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  

- **Price** 250 gp
- **Ammunition** any
- **Activate** command, envision

Mindlock shot is made of luminous ectoplasm in a crystalline form. When you command this ammunition, you pick a [Stride](stride.md) or [Strike](strike.md). If you hit a creature with the ammunition, it falls under a [mental](mental.md "Mental Effect Trait") effect that makes it use its first action on its next turn to take the action you picked. It chooses exactly how to use that action, and if you choose [Stride](stride.md), the target can [Step](step.md) if doing so is beneficial for it. On a critical hit, the target must use its next 2 actions to do as you chose, within the same parameters.
