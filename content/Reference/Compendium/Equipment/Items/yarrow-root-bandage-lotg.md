[alchemical](alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  

- **Price** 12 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Administer First Aid](administer-first-aid.md)

This root is often infused into bandages for life-threatening bleeding. [Activating the item](activate-an-item.md) is part of the same activity you use to [Administer First Aid](administer-first-aid.md) to stop bleeding on a creature who's also [dying](conditions.md#Dying). When you do, you can [Administer First Aid](administer-first-aid.md) to stop bleeding and [dying](conditions.md#Dying) as part of the same activity with only one [Medicine](skills.md#Medicine) check. However, the DC for the [Medicine](skills.md#Medicine) check is equal to the 5 + the higher of the two DCs to [Administer First Aid](administer-first-aid.md).
