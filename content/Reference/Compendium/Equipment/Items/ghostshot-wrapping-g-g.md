# Ghostshot Wrapping *Item 11*  
[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [illusion](illusion.md "Illusion School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 300 gp
- **Bulk** â€“; **Usage** affixed to a ranged weapon
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You attempt a ranged [Strike](strike.md) with the affixed weapon while [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected).

This long strip of linen is tightly wound around the barrel of the affixed firearm or the grip of a bow. When activated, the talisman's magic dampens the sound of the triggering shot, rendering it completely silent, and additionally skews the angle of the shot, so it appears to come from a different location and direction than your actual position. You don't become automatically [observed](conditions.md#Observed) to any creatures due to making the triggering [Strike](strike.md).
