# Druid's Crown *Item 6*  
[invested](invested.md "Invested Item Trait")  [primal](primal.md "Primal Tradition Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 220 gp
- **Craft Requirements** You are a druid.
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** worn headwear

Made of materials scavenged from wild places, a druid's crown can be rebuilt for a variety of benefits. The crown grants you a +1 item bonus to a skill, and can be activated to cast a spell, both depending on the material used to build the crown, as listed on the table below. If you invest and wear [druid's vestments](druids-vestments.md) along with the crown, the crown's item bonus increases by 1 and its spell's DC rises to 27. You can invest this item only if you're a druid. When you do, as a 10-minute activity that has the [manipulate](manipulate.md "Manipulate General Trait") trait, you can disassemble and rebuild the crown with different materials, changing its item bonus and spell accordingly.
