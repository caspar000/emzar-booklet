- **Ammunition** any
- **Activate** [Interact](interact.md)

This black-and-gray ammunition is etched with occult symbols and tiny, grinning skulls. When activated terrifying ammunition damages a creature, it fills the creature's mind with visions of their own failures, tragedies, and eventually, their own death. The creature must attempt a DC 20 Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Failure** The creature is [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) and can't reduce its [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) value below 1 until it spends an action, which has the [concentrate](concentrate.md "Concentrate Action & Ability Trait") trait, to calm itself down.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened).
