# Reflected Moonlight Fulu *Item 14*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md "Abjuration School Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [fortune](fortune.md "Fortune Effect Trait")  [fulu](fulu-som.md "Fulu Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 750 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You fail to save against a [negative](negative.md "Negative Energy & Element Trait") or [death](death.md "Death Effect Trait") effect.

An acolyte accidentally left fulu paper outdoors overnight during a divine ceremony to [Tsukiyo](tsukiyo-logm.md) conducted only during a supermoon, creating the first reflected moonlight fulu. When you Activate this fulu, you reroll your saving throw against the triggering effect and take the better result. If this new roll is a critical success, the effect is reflected on its creator, who's treated as the effect's target, with any negative damage converted to positive. A reflected effect or spell affects only the original creator, even if it was an area spell or one that affects more than one creature.
