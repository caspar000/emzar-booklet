# Ghost Touch *Item 4*  
[magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [transmutation](transmutation.md "Transmutation School Trait")  

- **Price** 75 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a melee weapon

The weapon can harm creatures without physical form. A [ghost touch](ghost-touch.md) weapon is particularly effective against incorporeal creatures, which almost always have a specific weakness to [ghost touch](ghost-touch.md) weapons. Incorporeal creatures can touch, hold, and wield [ghost touch](ghost-touch.md) weapons (unlike most physical objects).
