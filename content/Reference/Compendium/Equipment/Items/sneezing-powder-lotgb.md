You can toss sneezing powder at an adjacent creature as an [Interact](interact.md) action. The target must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid sneezing. On a failed save, the creature sneezes uncontrollably, becoming [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is instead [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for 3 rounds.
