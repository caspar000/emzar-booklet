[alchemical](alchemical.md "Alchemical Item Trait")  [bomb](bomb.md "Bomb Item Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [poison](Reference/Rules/Traits/poison.md "Poison Effect Trait")  [splash](splash.md "Splash Weapon Trait")  

- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Strike](strike.md)

Concentrated wolfsbane and other anti-shapechanger reagents fill trueshape bombs. These bombs grant an item bonus to attack rolls and deal poison damage, [persistent poison damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and poison splash damage, according to their type. If the primary target is under the effects of a [morph](morph.md "Morph Effect Trait") or [polymorph](polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") effect, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw at the bomb's listed DC, or else the effects end and the creature returns to its normal form. Targets taking [persistent poison damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from this bomb must succeed at another Fortitude saving throw at the same DC to change shape using a [morph](morph.md "Morph Effect Trait") or [polymorph](polymorph.md "Polymorph Effect Trait") effect.

The [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) can last up to 1 minute.
