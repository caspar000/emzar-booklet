# Caltrop Snare *Item 1*  
[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [mechanical](mechanical.md "Mechanical Hazard Trait")  [snare](snare.md "Snare Item Trait")  [trap](trap.md "Trap Hazard Trait")  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Craft Requirements** Supply a container of caltrops.

This snare consists of a [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) canister of [caltrops](caltrops.md) attached to a trip wire. When the snare is triggered, it flings the caltrops into either the snare's square or a square adjacent to the snare. You choose which square when you set up the snare.

If the [caltrops](caltrops.md) scatter into the same square as a creature, that creature must attempt the [Acrobatics](skills.md#Acrobatics) check immediately.
