# Vulture's Wing *Item 10*  
[catalyst](catalyst-som.md "Catalyst Item Trait")  [consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 200 gp
- **Bulk** L; **Usage** held in one hand
- **Activate** [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md)

This fan of vulture feathers scatters on an unnatural gust of wind. If this catalyst is used to cast a [ray of enfeeblement](ray-of-enfeeblement.md) spell that has been heightened to at least 5th level, instead of targeting a single creature, you cast the spell in a 30-foot-area cone. You don't make a spell attack roll, instead affecting all creatures within the area with the effect the spell would normally have on a hit. This means creatures within the area must attempt a Fortitude save to determine whether they're [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled).
