[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 140 gp
- **Bulk** â€”; **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You fail or critically fail a [Deception](skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](skills.md#Diplomacy), or [Intimidation](skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Coerce](coerce.md), [Lie](lie.md), [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md), or [Request](request.md); **Requirements** You're a master in the skill you failed with.

This ornate locket, usually containing a faceless, humanoid portrait, is typically worn on a chain around the neck or attached to your clothing. When activated, the charm casts a DC 26 [modify memory](modify-memory.md) spell against a single target of the check, removing all memory of your failed attempt and potentially allowing you to make another attempt. The effect can't remove more than 3 minutes of memories from its target.
