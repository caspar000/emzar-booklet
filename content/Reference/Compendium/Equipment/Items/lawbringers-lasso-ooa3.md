# Lawbringer's Lasso *Item 4*  
[evocation](evocation.md "Evocation School Trait")  [lawful](lawful.md "Lawful Alignment Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 100 gp
- **Bulk** 1; **Usage** held in 2 hands

This enchanted lasso is a net (Advanced Player's Guide 249) that can be used to [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md) creatures up to 30 feet away, requires a DC 18 [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics) check to [Force Open](force-open.md), and has an [Escape](escape.md) DC of 18. It's permanently attached to a 30-foot rope.

While using the lawbringer's lasso to [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md), you receive a +1 item bonus to [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md) checks against creatures with the [chaotic](chaotic.md "Chaotic Alignment Trait") trait. If you roll a critical failure on your attempt to [Grapple](Reference/Rules/Actions/grapple.md) a chaotic creature with the lawbringer's lasso, you get a failure instead.
