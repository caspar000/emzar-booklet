# Bane *Item 4*  
[divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [uncommon](uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")  

- **Price** 100 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a weapon

A bane rune causes a weapon to grant you improved understanding of creatures of a particular type, allowing you to deal more damage to those creatures. The crafter chooses [aberration](aberration.md "Aberration Creature Type Trait"), [animal](animal.md "Animal Creature Type Trait"), [beast](beast.md "Beast Creature Type Trait"), [celestial](celestial.md "Celestial Creature Type Trait"), [construct](construct.md "Construct Creature Type Trait"), [dragon](dragon.md "Dragon Creature Type Trait"), [elemental](elemental.md "Elemental Creature Type Trait"), [fey](fey.md "Fey Creature Type Trait"), [fiend](fiend.md "Fiend Creature Type Trait"), [giant](giant.md "Giant Creature Type Trait"), [monitor](monitor.md "Monitor Creature Type Trait"), [ooze](ooze.md "Ooze Creature Type Trait"), or both [fungus](fungus-b1.md "Fungus Creature Type Trait") and [plant](plant.md "Plant Creature Type Trait"). The weapon deals `1d6` additional damage of the weapon's damage type to creatures with the chosen trait or traits. The benefit doesn't apply against creatures of the chosen type disguised as other creatures. It's up to GM discretion whether the bane rune applies against a creature disguised as a creature of the chosen type.

The GM might allow bane runes for other creature traits, such as [astral](astral-b1.md "Astral Creature Type Trait"), [dream](dream-b2.md "Dream Creature Type Trait"), or [demon](demon.md "Demon Creature Trait"). However, humanoids, [undead](undead.md "Undead Creature Type Trait"), and specific types of humanoids (such as elves) are never a valid option.
