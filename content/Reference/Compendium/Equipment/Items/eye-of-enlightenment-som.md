# Eye Of Enlightenment *Item 5*  
[consumable](consumable.md "Consumable Item Trait")  [divination](divination.md "Divination School Trait")  [magical](magical.md "Magical Item Trait")  [talisman](talisman.md "Talisman Item Trait")  

- **Price** 25 gp
- **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You succeed at a [Strike](strike.md) with the affixed weapon; **Requirements** You're an expert in [Arcana](skills.md#Arcana), Occult, [Nature](skills.md#Nature), [Religion](skills.md#Religion), [Society](skills.md#Society), or a [Lore](skills.md#Lore) skill.

This dried eye was plucked from a magical creature. You combine your observation about your enemy's reaction to your [Strike](strike.md) with the stores of magical wisdom within the talisman to try to glean more information about the foe's true nature. When you activate this talisman, you attempt to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) about the creature you hit. If you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
